## Implementation Deviations from Plan

This document reflects **what was actually implemented** in Phase 2, including deviations from the original plan.

### Major Deviations

1. **Action Economy System** ⭐ (Not in Original Plan)
   - Added multi-action support (move THEN attack)
   - Added `requiresMove` and `requiresAction` fields to AIBehavior
   - Added `hasMoved`, `hasActed`, `canMove`, `canAct` to AIContext
   - Implemented re-evaluation loop after each action completes

2. **MoveTowardNearestOpponent Behavior** (Not in Original Plan)
   - Priority 10, move-only behavior
   - Ensures enemies advance when can't attack
   - Fills gap between AttackNearest and DefaultBehavior

3. **AttackNearestOpponent Simplified** (Design Change)
   - Originally planned to include movement logic
   - Actually implemented as attack-only (no movement)
   - Cleaner separation of concerns with MoveToward behavior

4. **Unarmed Attack Support** (Not in Original Plan)
   - Enemies without weapons can attack at range 1
   - Uses PhysicalPower only, no weapon bonuses
   - Required changes to CombatCalculations

5. **Debug Logging Gating** (Post-Review Addition)
   - Added `CombatConstants.AI.DEBUG_LOGGING` flag
   - All AI debug logs gated behind this flag
   - Production-ready console output

6. **Constants Extraction** (Post-Review Addition)
   - Added `CombatConstants.AI` section
   - Extracted all magic numbers to named constants
   - Single source of truth for AI configuration

---

## What Was Actually Implemented

### New Behaviors (3, not 2)

1. **AttackNearestOpponent** - Attack nearest enemy in range (attack-only, no movement)
2. **DefeatNearbyOpponent** - Move and attack to one-shot kill weak enemies (move+attack)
3. **MoveTowardNearestOpponent** - Move closer when can't attack (move-only) ⭐ NEW

### Core Enhancements

**Action Economy System:** ⭐ NEW
- Units can perform multiple actions per turn (move THEN attack)
- Behaviors filtered based on available actions (`canMove`, `canAct`)
- Automatic re-evaluation after each action completes
- Proper handling of `move-first` decisions with pending actions

**WeakMap Unit Tracking:**
- Added to AIContextBuilder for performance optimization
- O(1) position lookups instead of O(n) searches

**Unarmed Combat:** ⭐ NEW
- Support for units without weapons
- Range 1 (melee), uses PhysicalPower only
- No weapon modifiers applied

**Debug Infrastructure:** ⭐ NEW
- `CombatConstants.AI.DEBUG_LOGGING` flag
- All AI logs gated behind flag
- Constants for AI configuration

### Integration Points

- **TurnStrategy Interface** - Updated to accept `hasMoved`/`hasActed` parameters
- **EnemyTurnStrategy** - Implements re-evaluation logic and behavior filtering
- **UnitTurnPhaseHandler** - Rebuilds context and re-evaluates after actions
- **PlayerTurnStrategy** - Updated for signature compatibility
- **CombatCalculations** - Added unarmed attack support

## Bugs Fixed During Implementation

### Bug #1: Move+Attack Pending Action Lost
**Issue:** Pending attack after movement was cleared before execution
**Fix:** Check for pending action BEFORE evaluating behaviors in `decideAction()`

### Bug #2: AI Turn Stalling After Attack
**Issue:** `canAct` flag remained false, blocking re-evaluation
**Fix:** Re-enable `canAct = true` in `completeAttack()` before re-evaluation

### Bug #3: Thinking Delay After Re-evaluation
**Issue:** AI waited 1 second after re-evaluation
**Fix:** Set `thinkingTimer = thinkingDuration` when re-evaluating to skip delay

### Bug #4: Infinite Move Attempts
**Issue:** Failed moves didn't end turn, causing infinite loop
**Fix:** End turn when AI move fails (path calculation returns empty)

### Bug #5: Move-Only Actions Didn't End Turn
**Issue:** After move-only action, AI tried to move again
**Fix:** Check for pending action; if none, end turn for AI units

### Bug #6: Unarmed Enemies Can't Attack
**Issue:** Enemies without weapons had null attack range
**Fix:** Default to range 1 for unarmed attacks in AIContext

## Design Decisions

### Why Action Economy System?

**Original Plan:** Simple move-first, act-first sequencing
**Actual Implementation:** Full action economy with re-evaluation

**Rationale:**
- More flexible (units can move THEN attack)
- Cleaner architecture (behaviors don't need to know about each other)
- Future-proof (supports complex action combinations)
- Better gameplay (enemies feel smarter)

### Why MoveTowardNearestOpponent?

**Original Plan:** AttackNearestOpponent would handle movement
**Actual Implementation:** Separate MoveToward behavior

**Rationale:**
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- AttackNearest only attacks from current position
- MoveToward only moves (no attack)
- Both can be used independently or combined via action economy
- More modular and testable

### Why Simplify AttackNearestOpponent?

**Original Plan:** Include move + attack logic
**Actual Implementation:** Attack-only (no movement)

**Rationale:**
- With MoveToward behavior, movement logic is redundant
- Simpler code, easier to understand
- Clear single responsibility
- Works well with action economy system

### Why Add Unarmed Attack Support?

**Discovered Need:** Enemies had equipment IDs but weren't equipping weapons
**User Request:** "When attacking without a weapon, they should make an 'Unarmed Attack'"

**Rationale:**
- Not all enemies will have weapons
- Unarmed attacks use PhysicalPower only (no bonuses)
- Range 1 (melee) for unarmed
- Required for gameplay to work correctly

---

## Testing - ACTUAL RESULTS

### Manual Testing Scenarios

**✅ Scenario 1: Basic Attack**
- Enemy in range of player
- Enemy attacks nearest player
- Attack animation plays, damage applied

**✅ Scenario 2: Move Then Attack**
- Enemy out of attack range but within movement+attack range
- Weak player (defeatable in one hit)
- Enemy moves closer, then attacks
- Both animations play sequentially

**✅ Scenario 3: Priority Ordering**
- Multiple enemies, one weak (defeatable)
- Weak player farther than healthy players
- Enemy prioritizes one-shot kill over closer targets

**✅ Scenario 4: Move-Only Action**
- Enemy out of movement+attack range
- Enemy moves toward nearest opponent
- No attack (move-only)

**✅ Scenario 5: Unarmed Attack**
- Enemy without weapon
- Enemy attacks at range 1 (melee)
- Uses PhysicalPower only

**✅ Scenario 6: Action Economy**
- Enemy uses DefeatNearbyOpponent (move+attack)
- Enemy moves, then attacks weak target
- Turn ends after both actions complete

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Action Economy System** - More powerful than planned, enables complex behaviors
2. **Modular Behaviors** - Clean separation makes testing easier
3. **WeakMap Optimization** - Noticeable performance improvement
4. **Debug Logging** - Made troubleshooting much easier
5. **Code Review Process** - Caught issues early, improved quality

### What Was Challenging

1. **Re-evaluation Loop** - Complex to get right, multiple bugs fixed
2. **Turn Ending Logic** - Edge cases with move-only and attack-only actions
3. **Pending Action Management** - Had to refactor approach once
4. **Unarmed Attacks** - Unexpected requirement, needed design decisions

### What Would We Do Differently

1. **Plan for Action Economy** - Should have been in original design
2. **Earlier Testing** - Would have caught re-evaluation bugs sooner
3. **Constants from Start** - Easier to extract upfront than retrofit
