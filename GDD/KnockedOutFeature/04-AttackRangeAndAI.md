# Phase 4: Attack Range and AI Integration

**Status:** 📋 READY
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours
**Complexity:** Medium
**Related:** [KOFeatureImplementationPlan.md](./KOFeatureImplementationPlan.md), [KOFeatureOverview.md](./KOFeatureOverview.md)

---

## Overview

Phase 4 completes the Knocked Out feature by integrating KO behavior into targeting and AI systems. This ensures:
- KO'd units cannot be targeted for attacks
- KO'd units don't block line of sight
- AI completely ignores KO'd units in decision-making

**Key Insight:** The AIContext filtering change is the most impactful - it automatically fixes all AI behaviors without modifying individual behavior implementations.

---

## Goals

1. **Attack Range**: Exclude KO'd units from valid attack targets
2. **Line of Sight**: Allow LoS through KO'd units (they're "lying down")
3. **AI Context**: Filter out KO'd units from ally/enemy lists used by all AI behaviors
4. **Player Strategy**: Prevent player from targeting KO'd units in attack mode

---

## Files to Modify

| File | Lines Changed | Complexity | Critical Path |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| `models/combat/utils/AttackRangeCalculator.ts` | ~5 | Low | Yes |
| `models/combat/utils/LineOfSightCalculator.ts` | ~3 | Low | Yes |
| `models/combat/ai/types/AIContext.ts` | ~10 | Medium | **Critical** |
| `models/combat/strategies/PlayerTurnStrategy.ts` | ~3 | Low | Yes |

**Total:** 4 files, ~21 lines of code

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 4.1: Update AttackRangeCalculator

**File:** `models/combat/utils/AttackRangeCalculator.ts`

**Location:** Line 65-69, inside the loop where `validTargets` are identified

**Current Code:**
```typescript
// Check if there's any unit at this position (friendly fire allowed)
const unitAtPosition = unitManifest.getUnitAtPosition(tile);
if (unitAtPosition) {
  validTargets.push(tile);
}
```

**Replace With:**
```typescript
// Check if there's any unit at this position (friendly fire allowed)
// Exclude KO'd units from targeting
const unitAtPosition = unitManifest.getUnitAtPosition(tile);
if (unitAtPosition && !unitAtPosition.isKnockedOut) {
  validTargets.push(tile);
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Simple conditional addition - KO'd units not added to `validTargets`
- Preserves existing friendly-fire logic (all non-KO units are valid targets)
- No changes to `inRange` or `blocked` arrays (those remain independent of unit status)

**Testing:**
- KO'd units should NOT appear in yellow/green attack range highlights
- Active units should still be targetable normally
- Attack range calculation still respects LoS and walls

---

### Step 4.2: Update LineOfSightCalculator

**File:** `models/combat/utils/LineOfSightCalculator.ts`

**Location:** Line 47-50, inside the Bresenham line tracing loop

**Current Code:**
```typescript
// Check if a unit blocks line of sight
if (unitManifest.getUnitAtPosition(pos)) {
  return false;
}
```

**Replace With:**
```typescript
// Check if a unit blocks line of sight (KO'd units don't block - they're lying down)
const unitAtPosition = unitManifest.getUnitAtPosition(pos);
if (unitAtPosition && !unitAtPosition.isKnockedOut) {
  return false;
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Thematic:** KO'd units are lying down, shouldn't block sight lines
- **Mechanical:** Allows attacking enemies behind KO'd units
- Preserves existing Bresenham algorithm structure
- No performance impact (just one additional boolean check per tile)

**Testing:**
- Place KO'd unit between attacker and target - should still have LoS
- Place active unit between attacker and target - should block LoS
- Walls should still block LoS

---

### Step 4.3: Update AIContextBuilder (CRITICAL)

**File:** `models/combat/ai/types/AIContext.ts`

**Location:** Lines 183-200, in the `build()` method where units are partitioned

**Current Code:**
```typescript
// 1. Partition units into allies and enemies
const alliedUnits: UnitPlacement[] = [];
const enemyUnits: UnitPlacement[] = [];

for (const placement of state.unitManifest.getAllUnits()) {
  if (placement.unit === self) continue; // Skip self

  const unitPlacement: UnitPlacement = {
    unit: placement.unit,
    position: placement.position,
  };

  if (placement.unit.isPlayerControlled === self.isPlayerControlled) {
    alliedUnits.push(unitPlacement);
  } else {
    enemyUnits.push(unitPlacement);
  }
}
```

**Replace With:**
```typescript
// 1. Partition units into allies and enemies (exclude KO'd units)
const alliedUnits: UnitPlacement[] = [];
const enemyUnits: UnitPlacement[] = [];

for (const placement of state.unitManifest.getAllUnits()) {
  if (placement.unit === self) continue; // Skip self

  // Skip KO'd units - they don't participate in AI decision-making
  if (placement.unit.isKnockedOut) continue;

  const unitPlacement: UnitPlacement = {
    unit: placement.unit,
    position: placement.position,
  };

  if (placement.unit.isPlayerControlled === self.isPlayerControlled) {
    alliedUnits.push(unitPlacement);
  } else {
    enemyUnits.push(unitPlacement);
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **This single change fixes ALL AI behaviors** - DefeatNearbyOpponent, AttackNearestOpponent, MoveTowardNearestOpponent, etc.
- KO'd units completely invisible to AI decision-making
- No modifications needed to individual behavior implementations
- Clean separation of concerns: AIContext filters, behaviors consume filtered data

**Why This Works:**
- All AI behaviors receive pre-filtered `alliedUnits` and `enemyUnits` arrays
- Behaviors use `context.enemyUnits` to find targets → KO'd units never appear
- Helper methods like `getUnitsInRange()` operate on filtered arrays → automatic KO exclusion
- Attack range calculations use the manifest directly, but AttackRangeCalculator already filters KO'd (Step 4.1)

**Testing:**
- AI should never target KO'd allies or enemies
- AI should path normally (KO'd units allow traversal from Phase 3)
- All existing AI behaviors should work without modification
- Debug console should show filtered unit counts

---

### Step 4.4: Update PlayerTurnStrategy

**File:** `models/combat/strategies/PlayerTurnStrategy.ts`

**Location:** Line 680-690, inside `handleAttackClick()` method

**Find This Code:**
```typescript
// Check if this position is a valid target
const isValidTarget = this.attackRange.validTargets.some(
  target => target.x === position.x && target.y === position.y
);

if (!isValidTarget) {
  // Not a valid target, ignore click
  return { handled: true };
}

// Get the unit at the clicked position
const targetUnit = state.unitManifest.getUnitAtPosition(position);
```

**Add After Getting Target Unit:**
```typescript
// Get the unit at the clicked position
const targetUnit = state.unitManifest.getUnitAtPosition(position);

// Sanity check: Ensure target is not KO'd (should already be filtered by AttackRangeCalculator)
if (!targetUnit || targetUnit.isKnockedOut) {
  console.warn('[PlayerTurnStrategy] Attempted to target KO\'d or missing unit');
  return { handled: true };
}
```

**Additional Check in `updateHoveredAttackTarget()` (Line 609):**

**Current Code:**
```typescript
private updateHoveredAttackTarget(position: Position): void {
  if (!this.attackRange) {
    this.hoveredAttackTarget = null;
    return;
  }

  // Check if this position is a valid target
  const isValidTarget = this.attackRange.validTargets.some(
    target => target.x === position.x && target.y === position.y
  );

  if (isValidTarget) {
    this.hoveredAttackTarget = position;
  } else {
    this.hoveredAttackTarget = null;
  }
}
```

**Add Defensive Check:**
```typescript
private updateHoveredAttackTarget(position: Position): void {
  if (!this.attackRange || !this.currentState) {
    this.hoveredAttackTarget = null;
    return;
  }

  // Check if this position is a valid target
  const isValidTarget = this.attackRange.validTargets.some(
    target => target.x === position.x && target.y === position.y
  );

  if (isValidTarget) {
    // Additional check: Ensure target unit is not KO'd (defensive programming)
    const targetUnit = this.currentState.unitManifest.getUnitAtPosition(position);
    if (targetUnit && !targetUnit.isKnockedOut) {
      this.hoveredAttackTarget = position;
    } else {
      this.hoveredAttackTarget = null;
    }
  } else {
    this.hoveredAttackTarget = null;
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Defensive Programming:** Double-check that clicked/hovered targets aren't KO'd
- AttackRangeCalculator (Step 4.1) should already filter KO'd units from `validTargets`
- These checks provide safety against edge cases (e.g., unit becomes KO'd mid-click)
- Minimal performance impact (only executes on player input, not per-frame)

**Testing:**
- Player cannot click KO'd units in attack mode (click ignored)
- Hovering over KO'd units shows no orange highlight
- Clicking active enemy shows orange highlight and proceeds to attack

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Recommended)

Since Phase 3 now has comprehensive unit tests for movement pathfinding, consider adding unit tests for Phase 4:

**AttackRangeCalculator Tests:**
- KO'd unit within range → NOT in validTargets
- Active unit within range → IN validTargets
- KO'd unit blocking LoS → LoS NOT blocked (via LineOfSightCalculator)

**LineOfSightCalculator Tests:**
- KO'd unit on line between attacker and target → LoS clear
- Active unit on line → LoS blocked
- Wall on line → LoS blocked

**AIContext Tests:**
- Build context with mix of active and KO'd units
- Verify `enemyUnits` excludes KO'd
- Verify `alliedUnits` excludes KO'd
- Verify `getUnitsInRange()` only returns active units

### Manual Testing

#### Test 4A: Attack Range Exclusion

**Setup:**
1. Open combat encounter in browser
2. Create 3v3 units setup
3. KO one enemy unit within weapon range:
   ```javascript
   const units = window.combatState.unitManifest.getAllUnits();
   const enemy = units.find(u => !u.unit.isPlayerControlled);
   (enemy.unit as any)._wounds = enemy.unit.maxHealth;
   ```
4. Start player turn, enter attack mode

**Expected:**
- ✅ KO'd enemy NOT highlighted (no yellow/green on their tile)
- ✅ Active enemies highlighted normally
- ✅ Clicking KO'd enemy does nothing (click ignored)
- ✅ Hovering over KO'd enemy shows no orange highlight

**Edge Case:**
- KO unit mid-hover (wounds = maxHealth while hovering) → highlight disappears

---

#### Test 4B: Line of Sight Through KO'd Units

**Setup:**
1. Position units in a line:
   - Player at (5, 5)
   - KO'd enemy at (7, 5)
   - Active enemy at (9, 5)
2. Ensure player weapon has range 4+
3. Enter attack mode

**Expected:**
- ✅ Active enemy at (9, 5) IS highlighted (KO'd doesn't block LoS)
- ✅ Can click active enemy to attack
- ✅ Attack range extends through KO'd unit

**Comparison Test:**
- Replace KO'd unit with active unit → (9, 5) should be blocked (grey, not yellow)

---

#### Test 4C: AI Never Targets KO'd Units

**Setup:**
1. Create 2v2 encounter
2. KO one player unit:
   ```javascript
   const playerUnit = units.find(u => u.unit.isPlayerControlled);
   (playerUnit.unit as any)._wounds = playerUnit.unit.maxHealth;
   ```
3. Start enemy turn, observe AI behavior

**Expected:**
- ✅ AI never targets KO'd player unit
- ✅ AI targets active player unit
- ✅ AI moves toward active unit (ignores KO'd)
- ✅ No console errors about missing targets

**Debug Logging (Optional):**
```javascript
// Add temporary logging in AIContextBuilder.build()
console.log('AI Context built:', {
  allies: alliedUnits.length,
  enemies: enemyUnits.length,
  koFiltered: state.unitManifest.getAllUnits().length - alliedUnits.length - enemyUnits.length - 1
});
```

---

#### Test 4D: All Enemies KO'd

**Setup:**
1. KO all enemies except one
2. Start player turn
3. Attack last enemy until KO'd

**Expected:**
- ✅ Victory condition triggers (separate system - not part of Phase 4)
- ✅ No targeting errors
- ✅ Turn order shows all enemies as KO'd with grey tint

---

#### Test 4E: Revival Mid-Combat

**Setup:**
1. KO a unit
2. Verify it's not targetable
3. Revive unit:
   ```javascript
   (unit as any)._wounds = 0;
   ```
4. Next turn, observe behavior

**Expected:**
- ✅ Unit rejoins turn order (no longer grey)
- ✅ Unit becomes targetable again
- ✅ AI resumes targeting revived unit
- ✅ Movement/attack ranges recalculate correctly

---

## Integration Testing

### Full Phase 4 Validation

**Scenario:** Start 3v3 combat, KO 2 units (1 ally, 1 enemy)

**Validate All Systems:**
1. **Visual (Phase 1):**
   - ✅ Grey tint on map
   - ✅ Red "KO" text on tiles

2. **Turn Order (Phase 2):**
   - ✅ KO'd units at end with grey tint and "KO" label
   - ✅ KO'd units' timers stay at 0
   - ✅ KO'd units never get turns

3. **Movement (Phase 3):**
   - ✅ Can path through KO'd units
   - ✅ Cannot end movement on KO'd tiles

4. **Targeting (Phase 4 - NEW):**
   - ✅ Cannot target KO'd units for attacks
   - ✅ KO'd units don't block LoS
   - ✅ Attack range highlights exclude KO'd tiles
   - ✅ Hover highlights don't appear on KO'd units

5. **AI (Phase 4 - NEW):**
   - ✅ AI never targets KO'd units
   - ✅ AI ignores KO'd units in movement decisions
   - ✅ All AI behaviors work normally

---

## Performance Considerations

### Negligible Overhead

**AttackRangeCalculator:** `!unitAtPosition.isKnockedOut` check
- Executed per tile in weapon range (~10-30 tiles)
- Boolean check is O(1)
- Impact: <0.1ms per attack range calculation

**LineOfSightCalculator:** `!unitAtPosition.isKnockedOut` check
- Executed per tile on Bresenham line (~5-15 tiles)
- Boolean check is O(1)
- Impact: <0.05ms per LoS calculation

**AIContextBuilder:** Filter KO'd units during build
- Executed ONCE per AI turn (not per frame)
- Loops through ~10-20 units
- Impact: <0.2ms per AI turn (negligible)

**PlayerTurnStrategy:** Extra checks on click/hover
- Only executes on player input (not per-frame)
- Impact: <0.01ms per click/hover (imperceptible)

**Total Phase 4 Overhead:** <0.5ms per turn (well within 16.67ms budget for 60 FPS)

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise During Phase 4

**Revert 4 Files:**
1. `AttackRangeCalculator.ts` → KO'd units targetable again
2. `LineOfSightCalculator.ts` → KO'd units block LoS again
3. `AIContext.ts` → AI considers KO'd units again (will target them)
4. `PlayerTurnStrategy.ts` → Remove defensive checks

**Phase 4 is Self-Contained:**
- Phases 1-3 remain functional
- KO'd units still have visual indicators
- KO'd units still don't accumulate timers
- KO'd units still allow movement traversal
- Only targeting and AI behavior reverts

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 4 Complete When:

**Targeting:**
- ✅ KO'd units excluded from attack range `validTargets`
- ✅ Player cannot click KO'd units in attack mode
- ✅ Hover highlights don't appear on KO'd units
- ✅ KO'd units don't block line of sight

**AI Behavior:**
- ✅ AI never targets KO'd units
- ✅ AI `context.enemyUnits` excludes KO'd
- ✅ AI `context.alliedUnits` excludes KO'd
- ✅ All behaviors (DefeatNearbyOpponent, etc.) work without modification

**Integration:**
- ✅ All Phase 1-3 features still work
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ Performance maintained (60 FPS)
- ✅ Save/load preserves KO state correctly

**Edge Cases:**
- ✅ Unit becomes KO'd mid-hover → highlight clears
- ✅ All enemies KO'd → victory triggers
- ✅ Revival works → unit rejoins combat normally
