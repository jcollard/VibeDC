# Attack Action Implementation - Step 2: Add Range Preview

## Overview

This step implements the visual attack range preview system for the Attack Action. When a unit enters attack mode, the map displays color-coded tiles showing attack range, line of sight, and valid targets.

## Branch Information

- **Source Branch**: `attack-action-preview-range`
- **Target Branch**: `attack-action`
- **Status**: Ready to merge

## Changes Summary

### New Files Created (2)

1. **`react-app/src/models/combat/utils/LineOfSightCalculator.ts`**
   - Implements Bresenham's line algorithm for line of sight calculations
   - Checks if path between two positions is clear
   - Blocks line of sight for walls and units

2. **`react-app/src/models/combat/utils/AttackRangeCalculator.ts`**
   - Calculates attack range tiles using Manhattan distance
   - Categorizes tiles into: `inRange`, `blocked`, and `validTargets`
   - Handles walls, line of sight, and unit detection
   - Supports friendly fire (all units are valid targets)

### Modified Files (6)

3. **`react-app/src/models/combat/CombatConstants.ts`**
   - Added attack range color constants:
     - `ATTACK_RANGE_BASE_COLOR`: Red (#ff0000) for base range tiles
     - `ATTACK_RANGE_BLOCKED_COLOR`: White (#ffffff) for blocked tiles (walls/no LOS)
     - `ATTACK_TARGET_VALID_COLOR`: Yellow (#ffff00) for valid unit targets
     - `ATTACK_TARGET_HOVER_COLOR`: Orange (#ffa500) for hovered targets
     - `ATTACK_TARGET_SELECTED_COLOR`: Green (#00ff00) for selected targets (future)
     - `ATTACK_RANGE_ALPHA`: 0.33 transparency

4. **`react-app/src/models/combat/strategies/TurnStrategy.ts`**
   - Added optional `getAttackRange()` method to interface
   - Added optional `getHoveredAttackTarget()` method to interface
   - Imports `AttackRangeTiles` type

5. **`react-app/src/models/combat/strategies/PlayerTurnStrategy.ts`**
   - Added attack range state tracking:
     - `attackRange`: Cached attack range tiles
     - `hoveredAttackTarget`: Currently hovered target position
     - `attackRangeCachedPosition`: Position used for range calculation
   - Updated `getMovementRange()` to hide movement range in attack mode
   - Updated `enterAttackMode()`:
     - Deselects all units
     - Gets current position from manifest (handles moved units)
     - Retrieves weapon range from equipped weapons
     - Calculates attack range from current position
   - Updated `exitAttackMode()` to re-select active unit
   - Added `getAttackRange()` with position change detection
   - Added `getHoveredAttackTarget()` getter
   - Added `updateHoveredAttackTarget()` for hover detection
   - Added `recalculateAttackRange()` for position changes
   - Updated `handleMouseMove()` to handle attack mode hover

6. **`react-app/src/models/combat/UnitTurnPhaseHandler.ts`**
   - Added attack range rendering in `renderUI()` method
   - Uses priority-based color system (one color per tile):
     1. Orange (hovered target) - highest priority
     2. Yellow (valid target)
     3. White (blocked)
     4. Red (base range) - lowest priority
   - Renders after all units (overlays)

7. **`react-app/src/data/equipment-definitions.yaml`**
   - Minor equipment reordering (no functional changes)

8. **`react-app/src/data/party-definitions.yaml`**
   - Updated party member equipment for testing:
     - Ramza: Flame Blade (1-2 range)
     - Agrias: War Bow (2-5 range)
     - Ovelia: Heavy Crossbow (2-3 range)

## Features Implemented

### 1. Line of Sight Calculation
- Bresenham's algorithm traces line between positions
- Blocks on walls and units
- Excludes start/end positions from blocking checks

### 2. Attack Range Calculation
- Manhattan distance (orthogonal movement)
- Supports min/max range from weapons
- Categorizes tiles:
  - **Red**: Empty tiles within range
  - **White**: Walls or blocked by line of sight
  - **Yellow**: Valid unit targets (any unit with LOS)
  - **Orange**: Hovered valid target

### 3. Visual Rendering
- Renders in `renderUI()` (above all units)
- One color per tile (priority-based system)
- Semi-transparent overlays (33% alpha)
- Updates on hover for target highlighting

### 4. Position Tracking
- Calculates from current position (not starting position)
- Recalculates when position changes
- Caches position to detect changes
- Handles units that have moved

### 5. Attack Mode Behavior
- Deselects units when entering attack mode
- Hides movement range preview
- Re-selects active unit when exiting
- Tracks hovered targets for highlighting

## Technical Details

### Color Priority System
```typescript
// Priority (highest to lowest):
1. Orange - Hovered target
2. Yellow - Valid target
3. White - Blocked (wall/no LOS)
4. Red - Base range
```

### Attack Range Calculation Flow
```
1. Get tiles in weapon range (Manhattan distance)
2. For each tile:
   - Is it a wall? → Mark as blocked (white)
   - Has line of sight? → No: Mark as blocked (white)
   - Has a unit? → Yes: Mark as valid target (yellow)
   - Otherwise → Mark as base range (red)
```

### Rendering Order
```
render() method:
  - Movement range highlights
  - Movement path preview

[Units rendered by base system]

renderUI() method:
  - Animated unit during movement
  - Active unit cursor
  - Target cursor
  - **Attack range highlights** ← New
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Units with different weapon ranges (1-1, 1-2, 2-3, 2-5)
- Units before and after moving
- Hovering over valid targets
- Walls blocking line of sight
- Units blocking line of sight
- Friendly fire (all units are valid targets)

## Build Status

✅ Build passes successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ All features working as designed

## Code Review

A comprehensive code review was performed against [GeneralGuidelines.md](../GeneralGuidelines.md). See [02-AddRangePreview-CodeReview.md](./02-AddRangePreview-CodeReview.md) for full details.

### Review Summary

**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR MERGE**

**Compliance:** 100% - All critical guidelines met

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Rendering rules: Uses SpriteRenderer, cached tinting buffer, correct Z-ordering
- ✅ State management: Position-based recalculation, proper state cleanup
- ✅ Performance: Single-color-per-tile optimization, no object allocation in render loops
- ✅ TypeScript: Type-safe throughout, optional methods correctly implemented
- ✅ Algorithms: Bresenham's line algorithm and Manhattan distance correctly implemented

**Recommendations:** 2 optional minor improvements (non-blocking):
1. Reset mode to 'normal' when no weapons found (LOW priority)
2. Add JSDoc comment to positionKey() method (LOW priority)

### Performance Highlights

**Single-Color Rendering Optimization:**
- Uses priority-based Map system to render each tile exactly once
- Reduces draw calls by ~75% compared to multi-layer approach
- Priority: Orange > Yellow > White > Red

**Tinting Buffer Caching:**
- Cached as instance variable to avoid 720+ canvas allocations/sec at 60fps
- Follows GeneralGuidelines.md reference implementation exactly

**Path Pre-calculation:**
- Paths calculated once on mode entry, not per-frame
- Hover updates use O(1) Map lookup

### Guidelines Compliance Checklist

- [x] Uses SpriteRenderer exclusively for sprite sheet rendering
- [x] Rounds all coordinates to integers with Math.floor()

- [x] Correct render pipeline usage (renderUI() for overlays)

**State Management ✅**
- [x] Position-based recalculation implemented
- [x] State cleanup on mode changes

**Performance ✅**
- [x] Cached computed values (attack range, paths)
- [x] Off-screen canvas cached
- [x] Single-color-per-tile optimization

- [x] Type-safe position comparisons

## Next Steps

After merging this into `attack-action`:
1. Implement target selection (clicking on yellow/orange targets)
2. Display weapon info and attack stats in attack menu
3. Implement attack execution and damage calculation
4. Add attack animations and feedback
