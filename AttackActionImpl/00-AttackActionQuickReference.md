## Overview

The **Attack Action** allows units to attack enemies during the Unit Turn Phase. Players select targets within weapon range, view hit chance and damage predictions, and execute attacks with visual feedback.

### Core Features

1. **Attack Range Visualization** - Color-coded tiles (red=range, white=blocked, yellow=valid target, orange=hover, green=selected)
2. **Line of Sight** - Bresenham's algorithm checks if walls/units block attack paths
3. **Attack Menu Panel** - Shows weapon info, target selection, hit%, damage prediction
4. **Attack Execution** - Damage calculation, animations (flicker + floating numbers), combat log
5. **Dual Wielding** - Two independent attacks with separate rolls

### User Flow Summary

```
Click "Attack" ‚Üí See range highlights ‚Üí Hover/click target ‚Üí See prediction ‚Üí Click "Perform Attack" ‚Üí Animation plays ‚Üí Unit done
```

## Implementation Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Add Attack Menu Panel
**File:** [01-AddAttackMenu.md](./01-AddAttackMenu.md)
**Branch:** `attack-action` (commit `70ed5a0`)
**Status:** Complete

**What Was Done:**
- Created `AttackMenuContent.ts` panel with title, placeholder text, Cancel button
- Added attack mode state to `PlayerTurnStrategy` (`'attackSelection'` mode)
- Panel switching logic in `CombatLayoutManager` (shows AttackMenuContent when `activeAction === 'attack'`)
- Attack button highlights green when active

**Key Files Created:**
- `managers/panels/AttackMenuContent.ts` (230 lines)

**Key Files Modified:**
- `PlayerTurnStrategy.ts` - Attack mode toggle methods
- `UnitTurnPhaseHandler.ts` - `getActiveAction()` returns 'attack' in attack mode
- `CombatLayoutManager.ts` - Panel switching based on active action
- `CombatView.tsx` - Handles 'cancel-attack' click result

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Add Range Preview
**File:** [02-AddRangePreview.md](./02-AddRangePreview.md)
**Code Review:** [02-AddRangePreview-CodeReview.md](./02-AddRangePreview-CodeReview.md)
**Branch:** `attack-action-preview-range`
**Status:** Complete, approved for merge

**What Was Done:**
- Implemented Bresenham's line algorithm for line of sight (blocks on walls/units)
- Manhattan distance attack range calculation (orthogonal tiles)
- Color-coded tile rendering with priority system (one color per tile)
- Position-based recalculation (updates when unit moves)
- Hover detection for target highlighting

**Key Files Created:**
- `utils/LineOfSightCalculator.ts` - Bresenham's algorithm
- `utils/AttackRangeCalculator.ts` - Range calculation + categorization

**Key Files Modified:**
- `CombatConstants.ts` - 6 attack color constants + alpha

- `PlayerTurnStrategy.ts` - Attack range state, position tracking, recalculation
- `UnitTurnPhaseHandler.ts` - Priority-based rendering in `renderUI()`

**Technical Highlights:**
- **Single-color rendering:** Priority Map reduces draw calls by ~75%
- **Tinting buffer caching:** Avoids 720+ allocations/sec at 60fps
- **Position change detection:** Recalculates range when unit moves
- **100% GeneralGuidelines.md compliance** (see code review)

**Color System:**
```typescript
Priority (highest to lowest):
1. Orange (#ffa500) - Hovered target
2. Yellow (#ffff00) - Valid target
3. White (#ffffff) - Blocked (wall/no LOS)
4. Red (#ff0000) - Base range
Alpha: 0.33 (semi-transparent)
```

- Selected targets turn green (highest priority color)
- Attack menu displays selected target name in orange
- Weapon info section shows name, range, hit%, damage for each weapon
- Dual wielding support (two-column layout with 8px gap)
- Hit% and damage calculations (stub formulas: 100% hit, 1 damage)
- "Perform Attack" button appears when target selected
- Position data flows from CombatView through layout system to attack menu

**Key Files Created:**
- `utils/CombatCalculations.ts` - Stub hit chance and damage calculations

- **`PlayerTurnStrategy.ts`** - Attack mode state, range calculation, target selection
- **`UnitTurnPhaseHandler.ts`** - Rendering, active action state, attack execution
- **`AttackMenuContent.ts`** - Panel UI, button handling

### Utilities
- **`AttackRangeCalculator.ts`** - Manhattan distance, tile categorization
- **`LineOfSightCalculator.ts`** - Bresenham's algorithm, blocking checks
- **`CombatCalculations.ts`** - Hit chance and damage calculations (stub formulas, ready for real implementation)

### Constants
- **`CombatConstants.ts`** - Color constants (6 attack colors + alpha)

### Layout
- **`CombatLayoutManager.ts`** - Panel switching logic
- **`CombatView.tsx`** - Event handling, active action retrieval

---

## Technical Patterns

### Attack Mode State Machine
```typescript
PlayerTurnStrategy modes:
- 'normal' ‚Üí Click "Attack" ‚Üí 'attackSelection'
- 'attackSelection' ‚Üí Click "Cancel Attack" ‚Üí 'normal'
- 'moveSelection' ‚Üî 'attackSelection' (mutually exclusive)
```

### Attack Range Calculation Flow
```
1. enterAttackMode()
   ‚Üì
2. Get current position from manifest (not cached activePosition)
   ‚Üì
3. Get weapon range from equipped weapons
   ‚Üì
4. AttackRangeCalculator.calculateAttackRange()
   ‚Üì
5. For each tile in weapon range (Manhattan distance):
   - Is wall? ‚Üí blocked[]
   - Has line of sight? No ‚Üí blocked[]
   - Has unit? Yes ‚Üí validTargets[]
   - Otherwise ‚Üí inRange[]
   ‚Üì
6. Cache result + position
   ‚Üì
7. On next getAttackRange() call:
   - Compare current position to cached position
   - If changed ‚Üí recalculate
   - Otherwise ‚Üí return cached result
```

### Rendering Pipeline
```
render() method:
  - Movement range highlights (underlays)

[Units rendered by base system]

renderUI() method:
  - Attack range highlights (overlays) ‚Üê Renders ABOVE units
  - Priority Map ensures one color per tile
  - Cursors, animated units
```

### Line of Sight Algorithm
```
Bresenham's line algorithm:
1. Get all points along line from attacker to target
2. Exclude start (attacker) and end (target) positions
3. For each intermediate point:
   - Out of bounds? ‚Üí No LOS
   - Non-walkable? ‚Üí No LOS
   - Has unit? ‚Üí No LOS
4. All clear? ‚Üí Has LOS
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Step 4: Attack Execution)
1. Handle "perform-attack" click result in `UnitTurnPhaseHandler`
2. Create `AttackAnimationSequence.ts` for animations:
   - Red flicker (200ms, 50ms intervals)
   - Floating text (2s, moves up 12px)
   - "Miss" text (white) or damage number (red)
3. Implement attack execution flow in phase handler:
   - Roll hit/miss using `CombatCalculations.getChanceToHit()`
   - Calculate damage using `CombatCalculations.calculateAttackDamage()`
   - Apply damage to target unit
   - Create animation sequence
   - Add combat log messages (hit/miss/damage/knockout)
   - Set `canAct = false` after completion
   - Exit attack mode
4. Handle dual wielding:
   - Execute two sequential attacks (one per weapon)
   - Independent hit rolls
   - 4.4s total animation time (2.2s per attack)
5. Add knockout detection:
   - Check if target HP reaches 0
   - Set `isKnockedOut = true`
   - Visual indicator
   - Remove from turn order
   - Check victory/defeat conditions

### Long-term (Step 5+)
1. Replace stub formulas with real combat calculations:
   - Hit chance: Attacker accuracy vs defender P.Evd/M.Evd
   - Damage: Weapon power + attacker P.Pow/M.Pow - defender defenses
   - Distance modifiers (accuracy penalty, damage falloff)
   - Critical hits (weapon crit chance)
2. Implement damage types:
   - Physical vs Magical attacks
   - Elemental affinities and resistances
   - Armor vs magic defense
3. Enemy AI attack evaluation
4. Status effects, special abilities (future enhancements)

## Common Questions

**Q: Why does attack range recalculate when unit moves?**
A: Attack range is based on current position. If unit moves during their turn before attacking, range must be recalculated from new position. We cache the position used for calculation and detect changes.

**Q: Why render attack range in `renderUI()` instead of `render()`?**
A: `renderUI()` runs AFTER units are drawn, so highlights appear on top of sprites. `render()` runs BEFORE units, so highlights would appear underneath.

**Q: Why use priority Map instead of multiple render passes?**
A: Rendering red, then grey, then yellow, then orange would create 4 overlapping layers (overdraw). Priority Map determines final color first, then renders each tile exactly once. Reduces draw calls by ~75%.

**Q: Why query manifest for position instead of using cached `activePosition`?**
A: `activePosition` is set at turn start and never updated. If unit moves, it becomes stale. Manifest is the authoritative source for current position.

**Q: What's the difference between attack mode and move mode?**
A: Move mode shows movement range (yellow tiles, pathfinding). Attack mode shows attack range (red/white/yellow tiles, line of sight). They're mutually exclusive - entering one exits the other.

**Q: Can units attack after moving?**
A: Yes. Units can perform one movement and one action per turn in any order. Move then attack, or attack then move (if haven't moved yet).
