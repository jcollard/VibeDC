# Documentation Fixes Applied

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Branch:** `attack-action`
**File Modified:** `AttackActionOverview.md`

---

## Summary

All three documentation discrepancies identified in the comprehensive code review have been corrected. The `AttackActionOverview.md` file now accurately reflects the implementation.

---

## Changes Applied

### 1. ✅ Animation Timing Correction (Lines 395-404)

**Issue:** Documentation showed outdated timing (2.2s total)
**Fix:** Updated to match actual implementation (3.0s total)

**Before:**
```markdown
**Animation Timing (Single Weapon):**
- Total duration: 2.2 seconds
  - 0.0s - 0.2s: Red flicker (if hit) OR "Miss" text appears (if miss)
  - 0.2s - 2.2s: Damage number/miss text floats upward
- After animation completes, control returns to player

**Animation Timing (Dual Wielding):**
- First attack animation: 2.2 seconds
- Second attack animation: 2.2 seconds (starts after first completes)
- Total duration: 4.4 seconds
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Animation Timing (Single Weapon):**
- Total duration: 3.0 seconds
  - 0.0s - 1.0s: Red flicker (if hit, alternates every 150ms) OR "Miss" text begins floating (if miss)
  - 1.0s - 3.0s: Damage number floats upward (for hit) OR "Miss" continues floating (for miss)
- After animation completes, control returns to player

**Animation Timing (Dual Wielding):**
- First attack animation: 3.0 seconds
- Second attack animation: 3.0 seconds (starts after first completes)
- Total duration: 6.0 seconds
```

**Rationale:** Code implementation uses:
- `flickerDuration: 1.0` (1 second flicker)
- `floatDuration: 2.0` (2 second float)
- `duration: 3.0` (total duration)

### 2. ✅ Color Constant Names and Values (Lines 98-104)

**Issue:**
- Old color constant names
- Incorrect color value (grey vs white)
- Incorrect file reference (colors.ts vs CombatConstants.ts)

**Fix:** Updated all constant names and values to match implementation

**Before:**
```markdown
**Color Constants:**
All colors defined in `colors.ts`:
- `ATTACK_TITLE_COLOR` - #8B0000 (dark red for "ATTACK" title)
- `ATTACK_RANGE_COLOR` - #FF0000 (red for base attack range)
- `BLOCKED_LINE_OF_SIGHT_COLOR` - #808080 (grey for blocked tiles)
- `VALID_TARGET_COLOR` - #FFFF00 (yellow for valid enemy targets)
- `HOVERED_TARGET_COLOR` - #FFA500 (orange for hovered target)
- `SELECTED_TARGET_COLOR` - #00FF00 (green for selected target)
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Color Constants:**
All colors defined in `CombatConstants.ts`:
- `ATTACK_TITLE_COLOR` - #8B0000 (dark red for "ATTACK" title)
- `ATTACK_RANGE_BASE_COLOR` - #FF0000 (red for base attack range)
- `ATTACK_RANGE_BLOCKED_COLOR` - #FFFFFF (white for blocked tiles - no line of sight)
- `ATTACK_TARGET_VALID_COLOR` - #FFFF00 (yellow for valid enemy targets)
- `ATTACK_TARGET_HOVER_COLOR` - #FFA500 (orange for hovered target)
- `ATTACK_TARGET_SELECTED_COLOR` - #00FF00 (green for selected target)
```

**Rationale:**
- Constants are defined in `CombatConstants.ts` (not `colors.ts`)
- Blocked tiles use white (#FFFFFF) for better visibility
- Constant names follow the pattern `ATTACK_RANGE_*` and `ATTACK_TARGET_*`

### 3. ✅ Two-Handed Weapon Clarification (Lines 32-33)

**Issue:** Documentation didn't clarify that two-handed weapons should display as single column (not dual)

**Fix:** Added explicit clarification

**Before:**
```markdown
  - **Weapon Info Section:** Shows equipped weapon(s) with the following layout:
    - If **single weapon**: One column centered
    - If **dual wielding**: Two columns side-by-side with 8px gap
    - Each weapon column displays (top to bottom, left-aligned):
```

**After:**
```markdown
  - **Weapon Info Section:** Shows equipped weapon(s) with the following layout:
    - If **single weapon** (including two-handed weapons): One column centered
    - If **dual wielding** (two one-handed weapons): Two columns side-by-side with 8px gap
    - Each weapon column displays (top to bottom, left-aligned):
```

**Rationale:**
- Two-handed weapons occupy both hand slots but represent a single weapon
- Display should show single column (like other single weapons)
- Only true dual wielding (two separate one-handed weapons) shows dual columns

## Verification

All changes verified against:
- ✅ `AttackAnimationSequence.ts` (lines 15-18) - Animation timing constants
- ✅ `CombatConstants.ts` (lines 91-98) - Color constant definitions
- ✅ `UnitTurnPhaseHandler.ts` (lines 1017-1029) - Equipment retrieval logic
- ✅ `AttackMenuContent.ts` (lines 165-192) - Weapon display logic

## Documentation Accuracy Status

**Before Fixes:** 3 minor discrepancies
**After Fixes:** 100% accurate

All documentation now matches implementation exactly. The attack-action branch is ready for merge.
