## Lore Progression Through Areas

### Act 1: The Rot Spreads
- **Quest 1:** The Blight exists, corruption spreads
- **Quest 2:** Ghost mentions "fallen guardian" and "corrupted light"

### Act 2: Into the Blight
- **Quest 3:** Prophecy reveals "evil spirit hiding behind fair countenance" (The Blight possesses something good)
- **Quest 4:** **CRITICAL REVELATION** - Codex reveals Guardian Morel is possessed (not corrupted), The Blight is external parasite

### Act 3: The Final Confrontation
- **Quest 5:** Path to citadel clears, final preparations
- **Quest 6-7:** Confront The Blight, free Guardian Morel, purify Spore Pool, save Phlegm

**Narrative Arc:** Mystery → Investigation → Revelation → Confrontation → Resolution

---

## Design Notes

### World Structure
- **Hub-and-spoke design:** New Phlegm as central hub, all areas radiate from it
- **Gated progression:** Keys unlock new areas in sequence
- **Flexible mid-game:** Quests 2-5 allow some player choice in order
- **Linear endgame:** Quests 6-7 are strict sequence with no return

### Pacing
- **Act 1 (1 hour):** Tutorial, learning mechanics, world-building
- **Act 2 (1 hour):** Mastery, complex mechanics, lore reveals
- **Act 3 (45 min):** Endgame gauntlet, final boss, resolution

### Difficulty Curve
- Gradual increase from Quest 1 → Quest 5
- Sharp spike at Quest 6 (gauntlet)
- Final boss hardest fight (but fair with preparation)

### Player Agency
- **When to shop/prepare:** Between any quest (except after Quest 6)
- **Quest order (limited):** Quests 2-3 and 4-5 can be swapped
- **Optional content:** Exploration rewards thorough players
- **Moral choice:** Spare vs kill Infected Seer (Quest 3)

### Point of No Return
- Heavily telegraphed before Quest 6
- Free supplies given to compensate for no shopping
- Warns player explicitly: "Are you ready? No turning back."
