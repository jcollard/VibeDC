## Design Notes

### Difficulty Curve
- Act 1: Easy (tutorial, learning mechanics)
- Act 2: Medium-Hard (tests mastery, introduces complex mechanics)
- Act 3: Very Hard to Extreme (endgame challenge)

### Enemy Variety
- **20+ unique enemy types** using available sprites
- Color variations represent corruption stages (green → blue → red)
- Each area has unique enemy roster (prevents repetition)
- Bosses have multiple phases (escalating difficulty)

### Special Mechanics by Enemy Type
- **Undead:** Vulnerable to Bioluminescence (Turn Undead)
- **Oozes:** Split or explode on death (tactical consideration)
- **Ethereal:** Immune to non-magical weapons (requires magic)
- **Regeneration:** Must use fire/acid to stop (tactical requirement)
- **Level Drain:** PERMANENT loss until expensive cure (high stakes)
- **Petrification:** Requires specific counter item (preparation test)

### Boss Design Philosophy
- Each boss has a "trick" or required preparation
- Bloated Toad-Shroom: Fire/piercing damage
- Spectral Captain: Turn Undead to stun
- Infected Seer: Moral choice (spare vs kill)
- Head Archivist: Interrupt spellcasting, kill adds
- Vampire Mushroom: Fire damage REQUIRED (Cleansing Flame Gem)
- Guardian Morel: Protection from GOOD (the twist), melee only

### Treasure Balance
- Early game: Enough gold for basic upgrades
- Mid game: Enough for critical items (shields, gems, potions)
- Late game: Enough for endgame preparation (buffs, restoration)
- Post-game: Reward for victory (1000g bonus)
