# Quest 5: Deadcap Cemetery

## Overview
The Deadcap Cemetery is where the most poisonous mushrooms in Phlegm grow—death caps, destroying angels, and worse. The Blight has transformed this already-deadly place into a factory of undeath, where the dead rise as spore zombies and a vampiric mushroom lord drains the life from any who dare enter.

**Level Range:** 6-8
**Estimated Time:** 25-30 minutes
**Difficulty:** Very Hard
**Theme:** Death, Undeath, Life-Draining Decay

---

## Visual Design

### Environment
- **Walls:** Dark wall variants (biomes 34-37) - oppressive, tomb-like
- **Floors:** Dark with grey spots (biomes 45), Dark dirt (biomes 93)
- **Props:** Large mushrooms (death caps - vegetables-6), poisonous berry bushes (vegetation-4/5 recolored toxic)
- **Doors:** Dark passages (biomes 47, 16)
- **Lighting:** Almost none—minimal sickly purple/green glow
- **Color Palette:** Blacks, purples, sickly greens, deep reds—terminal decay

### Atmosphere
- **Oppressively dark** - hard to see, claustrophobic
- **Stench of death** - described often
- **Constant danger** - infections, poison, level drain
- **Hopeless** - this is where things come to die
- **Dread** - vampire boss is legendary threat

## Events & Story Beats

### Arrival
*"The cemetery gates loom before you, wrought iron twisted into shapes of dying mushrooms. A foul miasma hangs in the air—the smell of death and decay. Beyond the gates, massive death caps glow with sickly purple light. Shambling figures move between the tombstones. This is a place where hope comes to die."*

---

### The Warning Tombstone
**Location:** Just inside gates
**Text (on tombstone):** *"Here lies Captain Russula, slain by the Vampire. Turn back, adventurer. Only death awaits."*
**Optional Interaction:** Can leave offering (flowers/gold) for buff (+1 to saves vs charm for cemetery)

---

### The Vampire's Introduction
**Trigger:** Enter crypt chamber
**Text:** *"The massive red mushroom at the chamber's center pulses with stolen life force. Tendrils writhe across the floor, and a hundred eyes open across its cap. When it speaks, the voice is ancient and hungry: 'More... life... to drain...'"*
**Music:** Shifts to boss theme (intense, ominous)

---

### Victory Over Vampire
*"The Vampire Mushroom shrieks as your fire engulfs it. Its regeneration falters, and its massive form begins to wither. With a final, desperate wail, it collapses into ash. The oppressive atmosphere lifts. Deadcap Cemetery is silent at last."*

---

### Return to New Phlegm (If Level Drained)
Sister Oyster: *"You defeated the Vampire Mushroom?! Incredible! I see it drained your levels... Let me restore you. And given your bravery, I'll reduce my fee to 300 gold per person."*

## Design Notes

### Difficulty Spike
- Hardest area before finale
- Multiple deadly mechanics (infection, poison, level drain)
- Boss can TPK unprepared parties
- REQUIRES preparation (teach planning ahead)

### Preparation as Puzzle
- Game should HEAVILY hint at required prep
- NPCs warn explicitly
- Make items available in New Phlegm
- Failure = expensive resurrection/restoration

### Level Drain Impact
- PERMANENT until cured (serious threat)
- Restoration is expensive (500g → 300g with dialogue)
- Creates memorable "oh crap" moment
- Reward players who avoid it

### Boss Design
- Regeneration forces aggressive play
- Fire damage is THE solution
- Cleansing Flame Gem makes fight medium difficulty
- Without gem = extremely hard (but possible)

### Emotional Beat
- This is the "darkest hour" before final act
- Victory should feel EARNED
- Celebration in New Phlegm is cathartic
- Sets up finale with hope renewed

---

## Music/Sound

### Ambient
- Distant moaning
- Wind through tombstones
- Dripping poison
- Rustling mushrooms
- Heartbeat (vampire's presence)

### Music
- **Exploration:** Slow, mournful dirge
- **Combat:** Intense percussion, building dread
- **Boss:** Full orchestra, choir, epic and terrifying

### Boss Sounds
- **Vampire:** Deep, echoing voice, wet slithering, life-draining whoosh, regeneration pulse
