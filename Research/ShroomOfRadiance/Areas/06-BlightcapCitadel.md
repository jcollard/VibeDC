# Quest 6: Blightcap Citadel - Approach

## Overview
Blightcap Citadel is the corrupted heart of old Phlegm, where the Spore Pool of Radiance lies. The fortress surrounding it is crawling with The Blight's most powerful servants—elite guardians, massive trolls, and elemental cultists. This is the penultimate challenge before the final boss.

**Level Range:** 7-9
**Estimated Time:** 20-25 minutes

- **Color Palette:** Deep reds, blacks, purples—terminal corruption

### Atmosphere

## Design Notes

### Point of No Return
- This is the FINAL commitment
- No shopping, no resting, no turning back
- Game should warn HEAVILY
- Free supplies given to help

### Resource Management
- Gauntlet is designed to drain resources
- Players enter final boss weakened
- Tension: "Do I use this now or save for boss?"
- Smart play: conserve some resources

### Difficulty
- Hardest non-boss combat in game
- 3-wave gauntlet is brutal
- Tests everything learned
- Victory should feel like a miracle

### Emotional Stakes
- NPCs' goodbye raises stakes
- "This is it" feeling permeates
- Music should be epic
- Tone: desperate hope

### Pacing
- 20-25 minutes of brutal combat
- NO downtime (keeps tension high)
- Immediately flows into Quest 7
- Total finale runtime: 40-50 minutes (Citadel + Maze + Boss)

---

## Music/Sound

### Ambient
- Pulsing corruption
- Distant roars
- Dripping ichor
- Ominous chanting

### Music
- **Exploration:** Epic, ominous orchestral march
- **Combat:** Intense percussion, choir, building intensity
- **Gauntlet:** Full orchestra, multiple movements, epic battle theme

### NPC Farewell
- Emotional strings, hopeful melody
- Builds to triumphant send-off
- Quiets as player leaves town
- Transitions to ominous citadel theme

---

## Final Notes
This area is designed to be the "calm" before the final storm—except there's no calm, only a hurricane. Players should finish this exhausted, low on resources, but triumphant. Then Quest 7 begins immediately.
