# Pool of Radiance - Complete Game Overview

## Introduction

**Pool of Radiance** is a groundbreaking 1988 computer role-playing game developed by Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI). It was the first official Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) computer game and became the cornerstone of the legendary "Gold Box" series. The game implements 1st Edition AD&D rules and remains one of the most influential CRPGs in gaming history.

## Game Setting

### The Forgotten Realms
Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting, specifically in and around the city of Phlan on the northern shore of the Moonsea. This was one of the earliest video game adaptations of this now-iconic setting.

### The Story of Phlan
Once a proud and prosperous city, Phlan has fallen into ruin. Most of the city has been overrun by monsters, undead, and evil forces. Only a small civilized section remains, protected by determined citizens and guards. Adventurers from across the Forgotten Realms are coming to Phlan to help rebuild the city, clear out the monsters, and restore it to its former glory.

The ultimate threat is **Tyranthraxus**, a malevolent entity possessing a bronze dragon who seeks to control Phlan and the entire Moonsea region through the corrupting power of the Pool of Radiance itself.

### Historical Context
Pool of Radiance was released during the golden age of computer RPGs, competing with titles like Might and Magic and Wizardry. Its faithful AD&D implementation and tactical depth set it apart and established SSI as the premier developer of licensed D&D games for over a decade.

The game's success led to partnerships between TSR (D&D's publisher) and SSI that produced numerous classic titles across multiple D&D settings (Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Dark Sun, Ravenloft).
