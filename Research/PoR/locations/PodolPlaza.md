## Entry Options (CRITICAL DECISION)

When entering Podol Plaza, you must choose your approach:

### 1. Disguise Yourself as Monsters (RECOMMENDED)
- **Allows you to witness the auction** (primary objective!)
- Monsters won't attack on sight
- Can still complete all encounters
- **This is the ONLY way to see the auction event**

### 2. Stride Boldly Forward
- **Prevents witnessing the auction entirely**
- Immediate combat with monsters
- Objective will fail

### 3. Sneak, Remaining Unseen
- **Prevents bidding at auction**
- Can witness but not participate
- More dangerous encounters

**RECOMMENDATION**: ALWAYS choose "disguise yourself as monsters" to complete the primary objective!

1. Choose your strongest fighter

---

## Random Encounters

Podol Plaza requires **10 random encounters** to fully clear (in addition to witnessing the auction).

**Common Enemy Types**:
- **Orcs** (most common, 1 HD, AC 6, Sleep works)
- **Hobgoblins** (1+1 HD, AC 5, Sleep works)
- **Goblins** (1-1 HD, AC 6, Sleep very effective)
- **Ogres** (4+1 HD, AC 5, immune to Sleep/Charm)

**Typical Encounter Sizes**: 8-16 enemies per encounter

**Recommended Tactics**:
1. **Magic-Users**: Cast Sleep on goblinoids (saves many HP)
2. **Clerics**: Hold Person on orcs/hobgoblins
3. **Fighters**: Focus on ogres (immune to mental magic)
4. **Missile weapons**: Pick off sleeping enemies safely

**XP Farming**: Each encounter gives ~200-400 XP, so clearing the plaza yields ~2000-4000 total XP

---

|----------|-------|
| The Pitt (Duel) | Long Sword +1, Chain Mail +1 |
| Evil Shrine | 6x Leather Holy Symbol of Bane |

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Pre-Combat Preparation
```
BEFORE ENTERING:
1. Memorize Sleep (Magic-Users) - 2-3 slots
2. Memorize Hold Person (Clerics) - 1-2 slots
3. Memorize Cure Light Wounds (Clerics) - 3-4 slots
4. Full HP on all characters
5. Purchase healing potions (2-3 per character)
```

### Spell Priority
1. **Sleep** first (targets 4 HD worth, eliminates goblins/orcs)
2. **Hold Person** second (orcs/hobgoblins that saved vs Sleep)
3. **Missile fire** on sleeping/held enemies
4. **Melee** for ogres and immune enemies

### Positioning
- **Fighters in front** (AC 4 or better)
- **Clerics behind fighters** (casting range)
- **Magic-Users in back** (lowest AC, highest value)
- **Thieves on flanks** (backstab opportunities)

### Resource Management
- **Rest at Temple of Ilmater** after 2-3 encounters
- **Save Hold Person** for emergencies (Sleep is more efficient)
- **Don't waste high-level spells** (save for Kuto's Well boss)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Choosing "Stride Boldly Forward"
**Problem**: Prevents witnessing the auction (primary objective fails)
**Solution**: ALWAYS choose "disguise yourself as monsters"

### 2. Fighting Before the Auction
**Problem**: Blows your disguise, auction may not trigger
**Solution**: Go straight to (7-4) first, fight after witnessing

### 3. Attacking the Entire Bar
**Problem**: Much harder fight than 1v1 duel, same rewards
**Solution**: Accept the buccaneer's duel challenge

### 4. Not Finding the Hidden Temple
**Problem**: No safe rest location, must leave plaza to heal
**Solution**: Search coordinates (2-15), use high STR/Knock to enter

### 5. Discarding Holy Symbols
**Problem**: Can't enter Temple of Bane later without them
**Solution**: Keep all 6 symbols; you'll need them in mid-game

### 6. Wasting High-Level Spells
**Problem**: Podol Plaza enemies are weak; save spells for harder areas
**Solution**: Use Sleep/Hold Person, save Fireball/Lightning for Kuto's Well

## After Completing Podol Plaza

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Return to New Phlan Civilized Area
2. Report auction to Council Clerk (quest reward)
3. Sell unwanted loot at shops
4. Train to level up (if you have enough XP)
5. Memorize spells for next area

**Recommended Next Locations**:
- **Level 3-4**: [Cadorna Textile House](CadornaTextileHouse.md) (easier)

- **Level 5-6**: [Stojanow Gate](StojanowGate.md) (tactical battle)

---

## Notes and Tips

1. **Disguise Option**: The "disguise" choice doesn't prevent combat; it only affects the auction trigger
2. **Random Encounters**: These continue until you've had 10 battles, regardless of other objectives
3. **Multiple Visits**: You can leave and return to Podol Plaza as needed
4. **Holy Symbols**: Stack in inventory; you only need to show one to enter Temple of Bane
5. **The Pitt Duel**: Any character can duel; choose your strongest fighter
6. **Temple Location**: The Hidden Temple is easy to miss; specifically search (2-15)
