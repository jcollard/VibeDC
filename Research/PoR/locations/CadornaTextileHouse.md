## Location Description

The Cadorna Textile House was once a legitimate business run by Council Member Cadorna. Now overrun by hobgoblins and their monstrous allies, the building has become a den of crime and slavery. Your mission is to rescue Cadorna's loyal servant, Skullcrusher, who has been captured and imprisoned by the invaders.

The building contains multiple floors, secret passages, and a well that provides access to the Thieves Guildâ€”offering an alternative stealth approach for skilled rogues.

Legend:
W = Well to Thieves Guild (1-4) - Stealth entry (thieves only!)
X = Hobgoblin Entrance Battle (3-4) - Direct approach triggers combat
5 = Barracks West (6-4) - Hobgoblin forces
6 = Barracks East (6-7) - More hobgoblin forces
S = Secret Passage (2-7) - Thieves Guild exit point
8 = Temple/Grishnak (8-8) - Boss fight, get brass key
9 = Skullcrusher's Cell (9-9) - Rescue target (need key from location 8)
C = Ogre Chief's Lair (10-10) - Final boss, sealed iron box
```

---

## Two Approaches: Direct vs. Stealth

### Approach A: Direct Assault (Standard)

**Entry**: Walk through the front entrance at (3-4)

**Pros**:
- Simple, straightforward
- All characters can participate
- Fewer complex mechanics

**Cons**:
- Triggers combat with hobgoblins immediately at location 4
- More total combat encounters
- Higher HP/spell expenditure

**Recommended For**: Standard parties, first-time players

---

### Approach B: Thieves Guild Route (Stealth)

**Entry**: Climb down the well at (1-4)

**Pros**:
- Bypasses location 4 combat
- Secret entrance at location 7
- Thieves Guild can duplicate iron box seal (keep half the treasure without alerting Cadorna)

**Cons**:
- **ONLY THIEVES CAN CLIMB THE WELL**
- **Non-thieves will fall and lose almost all HP!**
- Requires splitting the party temporarily
- More complex to execute

**How It Works**:
1. Send ONLY your thief down the well at (1-4)
2. Thief contacts Thieves Guild underground
3. Guild shows thief secret entrance at (2-7)
4. Party reunites and enters via secret entrance
5. After defeating Ogre Chief, return to Guild for seal duplication

**Reward**: Thieves Guild takes half the iron box treasure, but you won't anger Cadorna

**CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT send non-thieves down the well! They will fall and nearly die!

**Recommended For**: Experienced players with high-level thieves, those wanting to keep Cadorna happy

---

## Key Locations and Encounters

### Location 1: Well to Thieves Guild (1-4)

**Description**: A deep well that leads to the underground Thieves Guild headquarters.

**CRITICAL RULE**: **ONLY THIEVES CAN CLIMB DOWN SAFELY**

**What Happens**:
- **Thief character**: Climbs down safely, contacts guild
- **Non-thief character**: Falls, loses ~90% of current HP

**Thieves Guild Services**:
1. Shows secret entrance at (2-7)
2. Offers to duplicate iron box seal (for half the treasure)

**Tactical Decision**:
- **Use if**: You have a thief and want to avoid combat or keep Cadorna happy
- **Skip if**: Direct assault is simpler for your party composition

---

### Location 4: Hobgoblin Entrance (3-4)

**Description**: Front entrance guarded by hobgoblin forces.

**Trigger**: Automatically occurs if you enter directly (not via Thieves Guild route)

**Enemies**: 12-15 Hobgoblins

- HD: 1+1d8 HP (~6 HP each)
- AC: 5 (Chain Mail)
- THAC0: 19
- Damage: 1d8 (Long Sword)
- XP: 15 each
```

**Tactical Notes**:
- These can be cleared separately or together
- Use area-effect spells (Sleep, Hold Person)
- Standard hobgoblin loot in each room

**Strategy**:

   - Focus all attacks on Grishnak until dead
   - Clean up guards after

3. **Spell Usage**:
   - Magic Missile (auto-hit Grishnak)
   - Hold Person (on Grishnak if she tries to heal)

   - **Magic Missile x2-3** on Ogre Chief (auto-hit, 2d4+2 damage each)
   - **Hold Person** on hobgoblin elites
   - **Missile fire** at held hobgoblins

3. **Melee Phase**:
   - **All fighters focus Ogre Chief** (35 HP total)
   - Use Skullcrusher as tank (AC 2, high HP)
   - Keep clerics ready to heal (Ogre hits for 1d10+3!)

4. **Spell Priority**:
   - Magic Missile (Ogre Chief)
   - Hold Person (Hobgoblins)
   - Cure Light Wounds (as needed)
   - Do NOT waste Sleep (Ogre is immune, hobgoblins have 2 HD)

**Expected Damage**:
- Ogre Chief can one-shot low-HP characters (max damage: 13)
- Keep all characters above 15 HP during fight
- Have 3-4 Cure spells memorized

**Loot - Sealed Iron Box** (MAJOR TREASURE):

Contents:

- Jeweled Dragon Statuette (500 GP)
- Jewel-Studded Bowl (300 GP)
- Gold-Banded Wand (enchanted item)
- **Gauntlets of Ogre Power** (18(00) STR when worn!)

**CRITICAL DECISION**: What to do with the seal?

#### Option A: Break the Seal (Standard)
- Take all treasure
- Cadorna knows you looted his box
- He becomes suspicious/angry
- No mechanical penalty, but story consequences

#### Option B: Thieves Guild Seal Duplication
- Return to Thieves Guild via well
- Guild duplicates the seal
- You keep half the treasure
- Cadorna never knows box was opened
- Maintains good relationship with Cadorna

**RECOMMENDATION**: If you used Thieves Guild route, return to duplicate seal. Otherwise, just break it (Cadorna's anger doesn't affect gameplay much).

### CRITICAL WARNING: Wights and Ghouls

**Danger**: Wights and/or Ghouls may appear in random encounters!

**Enemy Stats**:
```
WIGHTS
- HD: 3d8 HP (~13 HP)
- AC: 5
- THAC0: 16
- Damage: 1d4
- **SPECIAL: LEVEL DRAIN** (permanently lose 1 level per hit!)
- Immune: Sleep, Charm, Hold, Poison

   - Level 3 Cleric: Turns wights on 13+, ghouls on 7+
   - Level 4 Cleric: Turns wights on 10+, ghouls on 4+
   - Turned undead flee for 3d4 rounds

2. **If Turn Undead Fails**:
   - Magic Missile (auto-hit, bypasses AC)

3. **AVOID MELEE** if you can:
   - Wight hits = permanent level loss (NO CURE!)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Sending Non-Thieves Down the Well
**Problem**: Non-thief characters fall and lose ~90% HP
**Solution**: ONLY send your thief down well, or skip Thieves Guild route entirely

### 2. Not Getting Brass Key Before Location 9
**Problem**: Can't rescue Skullcrusher without the key from Grishnak
**Solution**: Always clear location 8 (Grishnak) before attempting location 9

### 3. Rescuing Skullcrusher After Ogre Chief
**Problem**: Miss out on Skullcrusher's help in hardest fight
**Solution**: Free Skullcrusher FIRST, then fight Ogre Chief with him in party

### 4. Not Using Turn Undead on Wights/Ghouls
**Problem**: Wights cause permanent level drain, ghouls paralyze
**Solution**: Always attempt Turn Undead before engaging undead in combat

### 5. Fighting Grishnak in Melee First
**Problem**: She casts Hold Person and heals herself, prolonging fight
**Solution**: Focus ranged attacks (Magic Missile, arrows) to kill her quickly

### 6. Ignoring Ogre Chief's High Damage
**Problem**: Ogre can deal 13 damage in one hit, killing low-HP characters
**Solution**: Keep all characters above 15 HP, heal immediately if someone drops below

### 7. Breaking Seal Without Considering Thieves Guild
**Problem**: Can't undo breaking the seal; Cadorna knows you looted
**Solution**: If you used Thieves Guild, return to duplicate seal before breaking
