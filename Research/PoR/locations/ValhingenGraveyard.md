# Valhingen Graveyard

## Overview

**Location Type:** Outdoor graveyard (extremely dangerous!)
**Grid Size:** Large (18x18+)
**Recommended Level:** 8-9 MINIMUM (attempt LAST before endgame!)
**Difficulty:** VERY HARD
**Quest Giver:** None (optional area)
**Reward:** Excellent treasure, high XP
**Primary Enemies:** High-level undead (mummies, wights, spectres, vampire)
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:** Cure Disease spells, Efreet Bottle, Turn Undead, best equipment
**Boss:** Vampire (two encounters)

## Background

Valhingen Graveyard is the ancient cemetery where Phlan's nobility and heroes were laid to rest for generations. Ornate tombs, crypts, and mausoleums dot the landscape, each marked with family crests and epitaphs honoring the dead. The graveyard was consecrated ground, protected by clerics of various faiths.

When Phlan fell to evil, the graveyard's protections failed. A powerful vampire claimed the largest crypt as his lair and began raising the dead as his servants. The vampire created a hierarchy of undead - spectres to raise specific types of undead, which in turn created lesser undead. The graveyard became a factory of death, churning out endless waves of zombies, skeletons, ghouls, and wights.

**This is the most dangerous non-endgame area in Pool of Radiance.** Parties that enter unprepared face permanent character loss from level drain, disease, and overwhelming undead numbers.

## Description

A sprawling cemetery shrouded in perpetual gloom. Weathered tombstones lean at odd angles, and mist crawls between monuments. Ancient trees with gnarled branches claw at the sky. Stone crypts and mausoleums dominate the landscape, some with doors hanging open, others sealed tight.

The atmosphere is oppressive - cold even in summer, with an unnatural silence broken only by distant moans and the rustle of shambling undead. The stench of decay hangs heavy. Statues of angels and saints, meant to watch over the dead, now seem to gaze with hollow malevolence.

**The graveyard is divided into three zones:**
- **Zombie Zone** (west)
- **Skeleton Zone** (north)
- **Level-Draining Undead Zone** (east) - wights, spectres

3. Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Magic Missile
4. **NO MELEE!** (2-level drain = permanent)

**vs. Wights:**
1. **Turn Undead** (priority #1)
2. If can't turn: **Ranged magic preferred**
3. Magical weapons if must melee (high AC fighters only)
4. Kill quickly

**vs. Mummies:**
1. **Ranged magic** (Fireball, Lightning Bolt)
2. Avoid melee if possible
3. **CURE DISEASE IMMEDIATELY AFTER** (mandatory!)
4. Check all characters
5. **DO NOT REST until disease cured**

---

## Notes

### Three-Zone System

**Zombie Zone (West):** Easiest
- Locations 1, 4, 5, 6
- Zombies, juju zombies
- One spectre (creating zombies)

**Skeleton Zone (North):** Easy
- Locations 2, 3, 11, 12
- Skeletons, giant skeletons
- Two spectres (creating skeletons, ghouls)

**Level-Drain Zone (East):** HARDEST
- Locations 10, 13, 14, 15
- Wights, spectres, VAMPIRE
- Permanent level loss risk

**Strategy:** Clear easier zones first, level-drain zone last.

### Spectre System

**Three Spectres Create Undead:**
1. Location 3 - Creates skeletons
2. Location 5 - Creates zombies
3. Location 11 - Creates ghouls

**Defeating spectres stops production temporarily.**

**Important:** Spectres respawn eventually (graveyard remains dangerous).

### Vampire Two-Phase Fight

**Phase 1 (Location 15):**
- Full HP (~40 HP)
- Has wolf allies
- Use Efreet Bottle
- After defeat: Flees to coffin

**Phase 2 (Location 14):**
- Only 1/3 HP (~13-15 HP)
- No allies
- Much easier
- True death

**Optional:** Sanctify area and destroy coffin between phases.

### Disease Mechanics

**Mummy Rot:**
1. Contract from mummy hit
2. Reduces max HP
3. Reduces stats (STR, CON, etc.)
4. Gets worse over time
5. **PERMANENT if rest before curing**

**CURE IMMEDIATELY:**
- Cast Cure Disease on all hit characters
- Verify disease gone
- **Do NOT rest until all cured**
- Can check temples if out of spells

### Level Drain = Permanent

**No Restoration in Pool of Radiance:**
- Drained levels CANNOT be recovered
- Character permanently weaker
- Lose HP, THAC0, spells, abilities

**Avoid at All Costs:**
- Turn Undead instead of fighting
- Ranged magic instead of melee
- High AC characters only if must melee
- **Best strategy: Don't get hit!**

### Experience Rewards

**Massive XP:**
- Spectres: Excellent XP each
- Vampire: Huge XP
- Overall: Enough to level 9-10

**Risk vs. Reward:** High risk, high reward area.

### Time Investment

**First playthrough:** 3-5 hours
**Experienced players:** 2-3 hours

## Tips & Warnings

### CRITICAL Tips

1. **DO NOT ENTER BEFORE LEVEL 8-9!** (party wipe)
2. **Memorize 4-6 Cure Disease!** (mummies)
3. **Get Efreet Bottle BEFORE entering!** (vampire)
4. **Turn Undead is essential!** (spectres, wights)
5. **CURE DISEASE IMMEDIATELY after mummies!** (don't rest!)
6. **NO MELEE vs. spectres!** (2-level drain = permanent)

### Common Mistakes

- Entering too early (under-leveled = death)
- Not bringing Cure Disease (mummy disease becomes permanent)
- Not having Efreet Bottle (vampire nearly impossible)
- Resting before curing disease (becomes permanent)
- Fighting spectres in melee (2-level drain = permanent)
- Not using Turn Undead (essential survival tool)

### Warnings

- **LEVEL DRAIN IS PERMANENT!** - Can't be reversed
- **DISEASE BECOMES PERMANENT!** - Must cure before resting

## Historical Background

Valhingen Graveyard was established centuries ago as the final resting place for Phlan's nobles, heroes, and wealthy citizens. The land was consecrated by clerics of Tyr, Torm, and other good deities, ensuring the dead would rest peacefully.

For generations, the graveyard remained sacred. Families maintained ornate tombs and mausoleums, and clerics of the death domains tended the grounds. The Paladin's Tower and Knight's Tower were built to house the remains of Phlan's greatest defenders.

When Phlan fell to the corrupting influence of the Pool of Radiance, the graveyard's protections failed. A powerful vampire, either created by Tyranthraxus's forces or attracted by the city's fall, claimed the largest crypt as his lair.

The vampire established a dark hierarchy: spectres to continuously raise specific types of undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls), which in turn created lesser undead. The graveyard became an undead factory, with waves of walking corpses shambling into the ruined city.

The vampire even raised mummies from ancient crypts, breaking seals that had held for millennia. These powerful undead guard key locations and spread mummy rot to anyone who dares challenge them.

Clearing Valhingen Graveyard is one of the final steps before confronting Tyranthraxus directly. The vampire's defeat weakens the undead forces supporting the evil entity and proves the party is ready for the final battle.
