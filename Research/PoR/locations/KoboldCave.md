# Kobold Cave

## Overview

**Recommended Level**: 3-5
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Primary Objective**: Eliminate kobold threat, rescue Princess Fatima (optional)
**Secondary Objectives**: Acquire Efreeti Bottle (CRITICAL for Valhingen Graveyard!), defeat wyvern
**Completion Requirement**: Defeat kobold throne room encounters + wyvern boss

**CRITICAL**: The **Efreeti Bottle** from this dungeon is **MANDATORY** for defeating the vampire boss in [Valhingen Graveyard](ValhingenGraveyard.md)!

---

## Location Description

The Kobold Cave is an underground complex located in the wilderness east of the Nomad Camp. A tribe of aggressive kobolds has been raiding caravans and killing travelers, including kidnapping Princess Fatima (an NPC who can temporarily join your party).

The cave features a unique entry hazard (pool of water), multiple combat encounters with kobolds and their allies (trolls, wild boars), and a wyvern boss at the deepest point. Most importantly, the cave contains the Efreeti Bottleâ€”an item that will be essential for defeating the vampire in Valhingen Graveyard later in the game.

---

## Critical Decision: Entry Hazard

### Location 1: Pool of Water (3-1) - ENTRY HAZARD

**Description**: Immediately upon entering the cave, a party member falls into a deep pool of water.

**What Happens**:
- One random party member falls in
- That character **loses currency** (copper, silver, electrum, gold, platinum pieces)
- Character is rescued by the party
- **Items and gems are NOT lost** (only coins)

**Exploit Strategy**: **Have your poorest character lead the party!**

**How to Minimize Loss**:
1. Before entering Kobold Cave, transfer all currency from party to one "banker" character
2. Have a different character (with 0 GP) lead the party
3. The lead character will fall in pool
4. Since they have no money, you lose nothing!
5. After rescue, redistribute currency from banker

**Alternative** (If you forget):
- Loss is typically 50-200 GP (manageable)
- Consider it an entry "toll"
- Items and gems safe regardless

**RECOMMENDATION**: Always set your poorest character as party leader before entering!

## Key Locations and Encounters

### Location 3: Kobold Negotiation (3-3) - CRITICAL CHOICE

**Description**: A kobold envoy approaches and offers a truce.

**Offer**: Accept a truce and skip directly to the wyvern (Location 14)

**Two Options**:

#### Option A: Accept Truce
- Kobolds lead you directly to wyvern boss (Location 14)
- Skip all throne room battles (Locations 7)
- Skip all treasure from throne room waves
- **Still get Efreeti Bottle (Location 10)**
- **Still get wyvern treasure (Location 15)**
- Much faster completion

**Pros**:
- Saves HP and spell slots
- Avoids difficult troll/boar battles
- Faster quest completion
- Still get critical loot (Efreeti Bottle!)

**Cons**:
- Miss throne room XP (~1,500-2,000 XP total)
- Miss throne room treasure (two-handed swords +2 from envoys)

---

#### Option B: Refuse Truce
- Kobold warns about ceiling collapse
- Ceiling caves in (minor damage to party, ~1d6 per character)
- Kobolds attack (10-12 kobolds)
- Must fight all throne room wave battles (Locations 7)
- Get all XP and treasure

**Pros**:
- Maximum XP gain (~2,500-3,000 total)
- Two-handed swords +2 from envoy battles (excellent weapons!)
- Complete dungeon experience

**Cons**:
- Harder battles (4 trolls + kobolds in wave 1!)
- Higher HP/spell expenditure
- Longer time investment

**RECOMMENDATION**:
- **Level 3-4 parties**: Accept truce (avoid difficult battles)
- **Level 5+ parties**: Refuse truce (handle trolls, get XP/loot)
- **Speedrunners**: Accept truce (fastest route)

---

### Location 4: Princess Fatima (5-4)

**Description**: A noble woman captured by kobolds, held prisoner in the cave.

**Encounter**: Peaceful (Fatima is friendly)

**Backstory**: Princess Fatima has a detailed backstory involving her capture.

**Joining Party**:
- Fatima temporarily joins your party
- She has moderate combat stats
- **Leaves party when you exit Kobold Cave**
- Cannot keep her as permanent member

**Fatima Stats** (Approximate):
```
PRINCESS FATIMA (NPC FIGHTER/THIEF)
- Level: 3/3
- HP: ~20
- AC: 5 (Leather Armor)
- THAC0: 18
- Damage: 1d6 (Short Sword)
- Special: Temp party member, leaves on exit
```

**Tactical Value**:
- Extra body for throne room battles
- Can backstab if positioned correctly
- Free 7th party member

**Dialogue**: Talk to her to learn backstory and have her join

**RECOMMENDATION**: Always recruit Fatima for extra firepower in throne room/wyvern fights!

---

### Location 6: Barracks (2-6)

**Description**: Kobold sleeping quarters and storage area.

**Encounter**: Kobolds (numbers vary)

**Tactical Notes**: Standard kobold combat

**Loot** (IMPORTANT):
- **Map to Nomad Camp** (shows route through wilderness)
- Standard kobold treasure (coins, small gems)

**Tactical Value**: Map helps navigate to Nomad Camp location in wilderness (useful for quest progression)

---

### Location 7: Throne Room Wave Battles (5-7) - MAJOR ENCOUNTER

**THIS ONLY OCCURS IF YOU REFUSED THE TRUCE!**

**Description**: The kobold throne room where their leaders command forces. You'll face three consecutive waves of increasingly difficult enemies.

**Total Enemies**: ~30-40+ across all three waves

---

#### Wave 1: Trolls and Kobolds (HARDEST WAVE)

**Enemy Composition**:
```
TROLLS (x4)
- HD: 6+3d8 HP (~30 HP each!)
- AC: 4
- THAC0: 13
- Damage: 1d4+4 / 1d4+4 / 1d8+4 (claw/claw/bite - THREE ATTACKS!)
- **REGENERATION: 3 HP per round** (MUST use fire/acid!)
- Immune: Regeneration stops only with fire or acid
- XP: 650 each (2,600 total for 4 trolls!)

KOBOLDS (x15-20)
- HD: 1d4 HP (~2 HP each)
- AC: 7
- THAC0: 20
- Damage: 1d4 (Dagger) or 1d6 (Spear)
- XP: 5 each
```

**Why This Is The Hardest Wave**:
- 4 trolls with **30 HP EACH** and **regeneration 3 HP/round**!
- Trolls attack **3 times per round** (claw/claw/bite)
- Can deal up to 12 damage per round per troll
- **MUST use fire or acid** to stop regeneration

**Tactical Strategy** (CRITICAL):

1. **Pre-Combat Buffs** (MANDATORY):
   - Bless (all party)
   - Prayer (all party if available)
   - Resist Fire (if you plan to use Fireball near melee)

2. **MANDATORY**: Use Fire or Acid!
   - **Fireball** (Magic-Users) - damages all trolls, stops regeneration
   - **Flaming Oil** (throwable, 1d8 fire damage, stops regen on that troll)
   - **Flame Tongue swords** (if you have them)
   - **DO NOT use regular weapons** without fire (trolls regenerate faster than you damage!)

3. **Opening Round**:
   - **Fireball at troll group** (10d6 damage = ~35 average, kills/nearly kills all 4!)
   - **Sleep spell on kobolds** (1 HD, instantly sleeping)
   - If no Fireball: throw **flaming oil at each troll**

4. **Follow-Up Rounds**:
   - If trolls survived Fireball: **Magic Missile** to finish (auto-hit)
   - **Melee with +1 weapons** (if trolls at low HP)
   - Clean up sleeping kobolds

5. **DO NOT**:
   - Attack trolls without fire/acid (they regenerate 3 HP/round!)
   - Let trolls surround casters (3 attacks each!)
   - Waste melee attacks on full-HP trolls (30 HP + regen = impossible)

**Expected Outcome**:
- With Fireball: 1-2 rounds (all trolls die/critically injured)
- Without Fireball: 5-8 rounds (very difficult, use flaming oil)

**Loot**: Standard troll/kobold treasure

---

#### Wave 2: Wild Boars and Kobolds

**Enemy Composition**:
```
WILD BOARS (x5)
- HD: 3+3d8 HP (~16 HP each)
- AC: 7
- THAC0: 16
- Damage: 3d4 (Gore attack, 3-12 damage!)
- Special: Charge attack possible
- XP: 120 each (600 total)

KOBOLDS (x15-20)
- Same stats as Wave 1
```

**Tactical Strategy**:

1. **Sleep Spell** on kobolds first (eliminate fodder)

2. **Focus Fire Boars**:
   - Each boar has only 16 HP (much easier than trolls!)
   - AC 7 (easy to hit)
   - No regeneration
   - Standard melee kills quickly

3. **Positioning**:
   - Keep casters away from boar charges (3d4 = up to 12 damage!)
   - Fighters intercept boars
   - Ranged attacks from back

**Expected Difficulty**: Medium (much easier than Wave 1)

**Loot**: Boar tusks, kobold treasure

---

#### Wave 3: Envoys, Trolls, Boars, Kobolds (MIXED FORCES)

**Enemy Composition**:
```
ENVOYS (x2) - BOSSES
- HD: 6d10 HP (~33 HP each)
- AC: 2 (Plate Mail, Shield)
- THAC0: 15
- Damage: 1d10+2 (Two-Handed Sword +2)
- **DROP: Two-Handed Sword +2 each** (EXCELLENT WEAPONS!)
- XP: 420 each

TROLLS (x2)
- Same stats as Wave 1 (30 HP, AC 4, regen 3/round)
- MUST use fire/acid!

WILD BOARS (x2)
- Same stats as Wave 2 (16 HP, AC 7)

KOBOLDS (x8-10)
- Same stats as previous waves
```

**Tactical Strategy**:

1. **Priority Order**:
   - Trolls first (use fire! Fireball or flaming oil)
   - Envoys second (bosses, but no special abilities)
   - Boars third (moderate threat)
   - Kobolds last (Sleep spell handles them)

2. **Opening Round**:
   - **Fireball on trolls** (if available)
   - **Sleep on kobolds**
   - **Magic Missile on trolls** (if no Fireball)

3. **Envoy Combat**:
   - Each has 33 HP and AC 2 (moderately tanky)
   - Focus all melee on one envoy at a time
   - Use Magic Missile for guaranteed hits
   - Keep HP above 15 (envoys hit hard with two-handed swords!)

**Expected Difficulty**: Hard (but manageable after Wave 1 experience)

**Loot** (EXCELLENT):
- **2x Two-Handed Sword +2** (from envoys - best two-handed weapons in mid-game!)
- Troll treasure
- Boar tusks
- Kobold loot

**CRITICAL**: The two-handed swords +2 are among the best weapons available at this stage! (1d10+2 damage)

---

### Location 10: Efreeti Bottle (6-10) - CRITICAL ITEM

**Description**: A brass bottle containing a trapped efreeti (fire genie).

**Encounter**: The bottle gives you a choice about a vampire.

**CRITICAL QUESTION**: "Have you been sent to kill a vampire?"

**Two Answers**:

#### Answer A: "Yes" (LIE)
- Efreeti is freed immediately
- **Bottle is DESTROYED**
- **YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK**
- **You will be unable to defeat the vampire in Valhingen Graveyard!**
- **GAME-BREAKING MISTAKE!**

#### Answer B: "No" (TRUTH)
- Efreeti remains in bottle
- You keep the bottle
- **Bottle can be used later in Valhingen Graveyard to defeat vampire boss!**
- **Correct choice!**

**CRITICAL IMPORTANCE**:

The Efreeti Bottle is **MANDATORY** for defeating the vampire boss in [Valhingen Graveyard](ValhingenGraveyard.md)!

- Vampire is immune to all weapons except magical fire
- Efreeti Bottle summons efreeti who uses magical fire
- **Without the bottle, the vampire is unkillable!**
- There is **NO other way** to get this bottle

**RECOMMENDATION**: **ALWAYS answer "No" to preserve the bottle!**

**Item Stats**:
```
EFREETI BOTTLE (BRASS BOTTLE)
- Type: Summoning item (one-time use)
- Effect: Summons efreeti to fight for you (one battle)
- Required For: Vampire boss fight in Valhingen Graveyard
- Rarity: UNIQUE (only one in game!)
```

**SAVE THIS FOR VALHINGEN GRAVEYARD VAMPIRE!**

---

### Location 14: Wyvern Boss (10-14)

**Description**: A large draconic creature guarding the deepest part of the cave.

**Boss**: Wyvern (solo encounter)

**Enemy Stats**:
```
WYVERN BOSS
- HD: 7+7d8 HP (~38 HP)
- AC: 3
- THAC0: 13
- Damage: 2d8 (Bite) / 1d6 (Sting)
- **Poison Sting**: Save vs. Poison or take additional 2d6 damage + weakness
- Flight: Can attack from above (ranged advantage)
- XP: 1,100
```

**Why This Fight Is Moderate**:
- Only ONE enemy (no adds)
- 38 HP (manageable for focused fire)
- AC 3 (decent but not exceptional)
- Poison is dangerous but single-target

**Tactical Strategy**:

1. **Pre-Combat Buffs**:
   - Bless (all party)
   - Prayer (if available)
   - Neutralize Poison prepared (cleric, in case of sting)

2. **Opening Round**:
   - **Magic Missile x2-3** (guaranteed 4d4+4 to 6d4+6 damage = ~15-25 HP)
   - **All ranged attacks** (arrows, bolts at AC 3)
   - **Fighters close to melee**

3. **Melee Phase**:
   - All fighters attack wyvern
   - Focus fire (only one target!)
   - Clerics ready with Cure Light Wounds

4. **If Poisoned**:
   - Cast Neutralize Poison immediately (or use potion)
   - Poison deals 2d6 bonus damage + stat reduction
   - Don't let poisoned character keep fighting

**Expected Battle Length**: 2-4 rounds (38 HP total)

**Loot**: Wyvern hide, treasure from lair (see Location 15)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use Magic Missile to chunk 50%+ HP in round 1, then clean up in melee.

---

### Location 15: Final Treasure (12-14)

**Description**: The wyvern's treasure hoard near its lair.

**Loot**:
- **Military Fork +1** (1d8+1 damage, rare weapon type)
- **Short Sword +1** (1d6+1 damage)
- Various coins (300-500 GP)
- Gems (100-300 GP value)

**Total Value**: ~1,500-2,000 GP

**Tactical Use**:
- Military Fork +1: Give to cleric or fighter (uncommon weapon, good damage)

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Pre-Dungeon Preparation

```
MEMORIZE:
- Magic-Users: Sleep x3, Magic Missile x3, Fireball x2 (if level 5+)
- Clerics: Cure Light Wounds x3, Bless, Prayer, Neutralize Poison x1
- Prepare: Flaming Oil x4-6 (for trolls if no Fireball!)
- Equipment: +1 weapons, AC 4 or better

CRITICAL ITEMS:
- Flaming Oil (necessary for troll regeneration!)
- Healing Potions (3-4 per character)
- Antidote Potions (for wyvern poison)
```

### Troll Combat (MUST KNOW)

**Trolls Regenerate 3 HP per round!**

**How to Stop Regeneration**:
1. **Fireball** (10d6 fire damage, stops all troll regen in area)
2. **Flaming Oil** (1d8 fire damage, stops that troll's regen)
3. **Flame Tongue weapons** (if you have them)

**DO NOT**:
- Attack trolls with normal weapons without fire
- Try to out-damage regeneration (impossible at low levels)
- Ignore trolls (they'll kill your casters)

**Recommended**: Save TWO Fireball spells for Waves 1 and 3 (4 trolls in Wave 1, 2 trolls in Wave 3)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Setting Poor Character as Leader at Entry
**Problem**: Lose 50-200 GP from rich character falling in pool
**Solution**: Always set poorest character as leader before entering

### 2. Answering "Yes" to Efreeti Bottle Question
**Problem**: Bottle destroyed, vampire in Valhingen Graveyard becomes unkillable
**Solution**: ALWAYS answer "No" to preserve bottle

### 3. Fighting Trolls Without Fire
**Problem**: Trolls regenerate 3 HP/round, impossible to kill with normal weapons
**Solution**: Use Fireball, flaming oil, or fire-based weapons

### 4. Not Recruiting Princess Fatima
**Problem**: Miss free 7th party member for difficult battles
**Solution**: Always talk to Fatima and recruit her

### 5. Accepting Truce Without Considering XP/Loot Loss
**Problem**: Miss two-handed swords +2 and ~2,000 XP
**Solution**: Refuse truce if level 5+ (handle trolls with Fireball)

### 6. Not Preparing Neutralize Poison for Wyvern
**Problem**: Wyvern poison sting deals 2d6 bonus + stat reduction
**Solution**: Have Neutralize Poison memorized or antidote potions ready

### 7. Splitting Damage on Wyvern
**Problem**: Fight takes longer, more chances for poison sting
**Solution**: All attacks focus wyvern (only one target!)

---

## Recommended Party Level and Composition

**Minimum Level**: 3 (difficult, especially trolls)
**Recommended Level**: 4-5
**Comfortable Level**: 5-6 (with Fireball)

**Ideal Party**:
- 2-3 Fighters (AC 3-4, +1 weapons, 25+ HP each)
- 1-2 Clerics (Cure Light Wounds x3, Bless, Neutralize Poison, 18+ HP)
- 1-2 Magic-Users (Sleep x3, Magic Missile x3, **Fireball x2**, 12+ HP)
- 1 Thief (backstab, 15+ HP)

**Critical Requirements**:
- **Magic-User with Fireball x2** (absolutely critical for troll waves!)
- **Flaming Oil x4-6** (if no Fireball available)
- Neutralize Poison (cleric spell, for wyvern sting)
- Total party HP: 120+ combined
- Average AC: 4 or better

**Without Fireball**: Level 6+ recommended (can tank trolls with high HP/AC)

## Notes and Tips

1. **Efreeti Bottle**: MOST IMPORTANT item in dungeon; required for vampire; answer "No" to preserve!
2. **Truce Decision**: Accept = fast/easy, Refuse = more XP/loot (two-handed swords +2)
3. **Troll Regeneration**: MUST use fire or acid; Fireball is best solution (10d6 to all trolls)
4. **Pool Entry Loss**: Set poorest character as leader to minimize currency loss
5. **Princess Fatima**: Free temporary party member; use for extra damage in battles
6. **Two-Handed Sword +2**: Best two-handed weapon in mid-game (1d10+2 damage!)
7. **Wyvern Poison**: Keep Neutralize Poison ready; poison adds 2d6 damage + stat loss
8. **Flaming Oil Alternative**: If no Fireball, bring 4-6 flaming oils for trolls
9. **Wave 1 Hardest**: 4 trolls with 120 HP total + regeneration = use Fireball!
10. **Map to Nomad Camp**: Helps navigate wilderness for connected quests
