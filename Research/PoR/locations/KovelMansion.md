## Location Description

Kovel Mansion was once an elegant estate belonging to a wealthy noble family. Now abandoned by its original owners, the mansion has been taken over by the local Thieves Guild, who use it as a base of operations. The building is filled with traps, ambushes, and hidden treasures.

Your mission is to clear out the thieves and recover any intelligence about the growing threat to New Phlan. Importantly, you'll discover maps of **Valjevo Castle** (the final dungeon) and critical information about "The Boss"â€”a metallic dragon possessed by Tyranthraxus the Flamed One.

## Critical Intelligence: Maps and Journal Entries

**MAJOR DISCOVERY**: Kovel Mansion contains crucial endgame information!

### Maps Found
- **Two quadrants of Valjevo Castle** (final dungeon)
- Shows layout and key locations
- Critical for planning final assault

### Journal Entries Discovered
Journal entries found: **29, 41, 38, 51, 48, 14, 23**

**Journal Entry 48** (from dying thief at location 11):
- Intelligence on "The Boss"
- Reveals The Boss is a **metallic dragon**
- Dragon has fallen under influence of **Tyranthraxus the Flamed One**
- Critical tactical information for endgame

**IMPORTANT**: Read all journal entries carefully! They contain vital story and tactical information.

---

## Entry Strategy and First Encounters

### Entrance Recommendation

**CRITICAL**: Enter from the **NORTH** entrance!

**Why**:
- Three western doors are **fake entrances** (waste time)
- North entrance provides optimal path through mansion
- Shorter route to critical locations

---

### Location 1: Entry Thief (2-1)

**Description**: Immediately upon entry, a lone thief rushes to attack.

**Encounter**: 1 Thief (Level 1)

**Enemy Stats**:
```
LEVEL 1 THIEF
- HD: 1d6 HP (~4 HP)
- AC: 7 (Leather Armor)
- THAC0: 20
- Damage: 1d4 (Dagger)
- XP: 20
```

**Options Presented**:
1. Attack
2. Let go

**Tactical Notes**:
- Both options lead to same outcome (thief dies/flees)
- Very easy fight
- Minimal loot

**Strategy**: Kill quickly and move on. This is a trivial encounter designed to introduce the mansion's theme.

---

### Location 2: Trap (3-2)

**Description**: The first of many traps in the mansion.

**Trap Type**: Varies (poison dart, blade, etc.)

**Damage**: 1d6-2d6 (minimal but cumulative)

**Detection**:
- **Search Mode**: High chance to detect before triggering
- **Passive**: Low chance to notice without searching
- **Thief Skill**: Best detection rate

**Disarm Options**:
1. **Avoid** (go around if detected)
2. **Disarm** (thief skill check)

**CRITICAL RULE**: **ALWAYS USE SEARCH MODE** in Kovel Mansion!

**Tactical Importance**:
- Traps appear throughout mansion
- Cumulative damage adds up
- Failed disarm still triggers trap
- Search mode drastically increases detection

**RECOMMENDATION**: Turn on search mode immediately upon entering and leave it on for the entire dungeon!

---

## Key Locations and Encounters

### Location 3: Weapons Pile (5-3)

**Description**: A cache of magical weapons guarded by multiple first-level thieves.

**Enemies**: 8-10 Level 1 Thieves

**Enemy Stats**: Same as Location 1 (1d6 HP, AC 7, THAC0 20)

**Tactical Strategy**:
1. **Sleep spell** (will affect most/all thieves - they have 1 HD)
2. **Missile fire** on sleeping thieves
3. **Melee cleanup** if any resist

**Loot** (EXCELLENT):
- **Cursed Broad Sword -2** (do not equip!)
- **Chain Mail +1**
- **Shield +2**
- **Short Sword +1**
- **Scimitar +1**
- **Morning Star +1**
- **Hammer +1**
- **Dagger +1**

**Value**: ~8,000-10,000 GP worth of magical equipment!

**RECOMMENDATION**: This is one of the best treasure rooms in the early-mid game. Clear it early!

**WARNING**: Do NOT equip the Cursed Broad Sword -2! It gives -2 penalty and you can't unequip it without Remove Curse!

---

### Location 4: Two Fleeing Thieves (7-5)

**Description**: Two thieves encounter the party and flee in different directions.

**Options**:
1. One thief heads **south** (leads to ambush at location 9)
2. One thief heads **east** (claims to be fake guildmaster)

**Enemy Stats**: 2 Level 1 Thieves (same as location 1)

**TACTICAL RECOMMENDATION**: **IGNORE THEM BOTH!**

**Why**:
- Chasing them wastes time
- Southern thief leads to ambush (location 9) - you'll encounter anyway
- Eastern thief is lying about guildmaster status
- No valuable loot from pursuing
- Better to proceed methodically through mansion

**Strategy**: Let them flee, continue systematic exploration.

---

### Locations 6-7: Trapped Treasure Rooms

#### Location 6: Casket Trap (2-6)

**Description**: Trapped casket containing jewelry and gems.

**Trap**: Poison needle or similar

**Contents**:
- Jewelry (various, 200-400 GP value)
- Gems (various, 100-300 GP value)

**Procedure**:
1. Use search mode to detect trap
2. Disarm with thief
3. Open casket carefully
4. Loot contents

---

#### Location 7: Scroll Room (11-6)

**Description**: Room containing valuable magical and clerical scrolls.

**Trap**: Multiple traps (casket itself + room traps)

**Contents** (VALUABLE):
- **Clerical Scrolls**: Cure Serious Wounds, Cure Critical Wounds, Neutralize Poison
- **Magic User Scrolls**: **Fireball**, **Haste**, Shield, Magic Missile
- Other miscellaneous scrolls

**Value**: Fireball and Haste scrolls are especially valuable!

**Procedure**:
1. Search mode to detect room traps
2. Disarm room traps
3. Detect casket trap
4. Disarm casket trap
5. Loot scrolls

**CRITICAL**: Fireball scroll can be scribed to spellbook by Magic-Users! Extremely valuable!

---

### Location 9: Ambush Hallway (9-9) - MAJOR ENCOUNTER

**Description**: The largest combat encounter in Kovel Mansion. Approximately 20 first-level thieves ambush the party in a hallway.

**Enemies**: ~20 Level 1 Thieves

**Enemy Stats** (Each):
```
LEVEL 1 THIEF (x20)
- HD: 1d6 HP (~4 HP each)
- AC: 7 (Leather Armor)
- THAC0: 20
- Damage: 1d4 (Dagger) or 1d6 (Short Sword)
- XP: 20 each (400 total!)
```

**Why This Fight Is Easy Despite Numbers**:
- Each thief has only ~4 HP
- AC 7 is very low (easy to hit)
- Low damage output (1d4-1d6)
- Vulnerable to Sleep and other area spells

**Tactical Strategy**:

1. **Pre-Combat** (if you see them coming):
   - Position fighters in a **chokepoint**
   - Casters in back row
   - Prepare area-effect spells

2. **Opening Round**:
   - **Sleep spell x2** (each affects 4 HD worth = ~4 thieves per spell)
   - **Hold Person** (clerics, targets 1d4 thieves)
   - **Fireball** (if you scribed the scroll from location 7!)

3. **Follow-Up Rounds**:
   - **Missile fire** at sleeping thieves (auto-hit)
   - **Melee** against held/sleeping enemies
   - **Magic Missile** at any still fighting

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Most thieves will be sleeping or held
   - Kill systematically
   - Watch for fleeing enemies

**Expected Outcome**:
- 2-3 rounds of combat
- Minimal damage taken (low thief THAC0)
- ~400 XP total
- Small treasure

**CRITICAL**: Despite 20 enemies, this is surprisingly easy due to Sleep spell effectiveness!

**Loot**: Standard thief equipment, small coins, daggers

---

### Location 11: Jail Cell - Dying Thief (11-11)

**Description**: A prison cell containing a dying thief who provides critical intelligence.

**Encounter**: Peaceful (dying NPC)

**Guards**: 10 Level 1 Thieves

**Enemy Stats**: Same as other thieves (4 HP, AC 7)

**Tactical Strategy**:
- Sleep spell handles most guards
- Standard cleanup

**Information Gained** (CRITICAL):

**Journal Entry 48**:
- "The Boss" is a **metallic dragon**
- Dragon is possessed by **Tyranthraxus the Flamed One**
- Dragon's alignment is **good** (despite possession)
- Implications for Protection from Evil vs. Protection from GOOD

**IMPORTANCE**: This is your first concrete intelligence that the final boss is a dragon! Critical for planning endgame buffs and tactics.

**Loot**: Minimal treasure from guards

---

### Location 12: Best Loot Room (13-12) - CRITICAL TREASURE

**Description**: A hidden or trapped room containing the two best items in Kovel Mansion.

**Trap**: Likely trapped (use search mode!)

**Contents** (OUTSTANDING):

1. **Short Sword +2**
   - Damage: 1d6+2
   - THAC0: +2
   - Best short sword in mid-game
   - Perfect for thieves (backstab weapon)

2. **Leather Armor +4** (BEST ARMOR IN MID-GAME!)
   - AC: 4 (8-4=4, same as Chain Mail +1)
   - Weight: 15 lbs (vs. 30 lbs for chain)
   - **No movement penalty**
   - **Thieves and magic-users can wear!**
   - **Single best armor for anyone with DEX 16+**

**Tactical Value**:

**Leather Armor +4** is exceptional because:
- Equivalent AC to much heavier armor
- No stealth penalty for thieves
- Magic-users can wear (normally limited to no armor)
- Combined with high DEX, can achieve AC 2-3!

**Example**:
- Thief with DEX 18 (AC 10 - 4 DEX bonus = AC 6)
- Wearing Leather +4 = AC 2!
- Can still backstab and hide in shadows!

**RECOMMENDATION**: Give Leather +4 to your thief or high-DEX magic-user. Give Short Sword +2 to your primary thief (backstab weapon).

---

### Location 13: Currency Room (15-13)

**Description**: Hidden cache of currency.

**Contents**:
- **1,500 Silver Pieces** (150 GP value)
- **1,800 Gold Pieces**

**Total Value**: 1,950 GP

**Trap**: Likely trapped

**Strategy**: Standard search, disarm, loot procedure

---

### Location 14: Tapestries (16-14)

**Description**: Room containing heavy valuable tapestries.

**Contents**: Multiple ornate tapestries

**Value**: ~500-800 GP total

**Weight**: HEAVY (each tapestry weighs significant amount)

**Tactical Decision**:
- Take if you have carrying capacity
- Leave if encumbered
- Can return later if needed

**Recommendation**: Take if possible (good value for shop sale)

---

## Random Encounters

**Frequency**: Lower than most dungeons (Kovel Mansion has many scripted encounters)

**Common Enemies**:
- Individual thieves (1-3 at a time)
- Small thief groups (4-6)

**XP Value**: Minimal (20 XP per thief)

**Tactical Note**: Random encounters are trivial compared to scripted ones. Save spell slots for major fights.

---

## Traps Guide

### Trap Locations
Traps appear at numerous locations throughout Kovel Mansion:
- Location 2 (early trap)
- Location 6 (casket trap)
- Location 7 (scroll room - multiple traps)
- Various hallways and doorways
- Most treasure containers

### Trap Types
- **Poison Darts**: 1d4 damage + poison (save vs. poison or additional damage)
- **Blade Traps**: 1d6 damage
- **Pit Traps**: 2d6 falling damage
- **Alarm Traps**: Summon additional enemies

### Detection and Disarming

**Search Mode**:
- Dramatically increases trap detection
- Slows movement speed
- Worth the time investment

**Thief Skills**:
- Find Traps: Higher skill = better detection
- Remove Traps: Higher skill = better disarm chance
- Failed disarm = trap triggers

**Non-Thief Options**:
- Some traps can be avoided once detected
- High-HP characters can tank minor traps
- Healing is cheaper than multiple trap triggers

**RECOMMENDATION**: Keep search mode ON for entire mansion, let thief lead party.

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Pre-Dungeon Preparation

```
MEMORIZE:
- Magic-Users: Sleep x3, Magic Missile x2, Shield
- Clerics: Cure Light Wounds x3, Hold Person x1, Bless
- Prepare: Healing Potions (1-2 per character)
- Equipment: Thieves' tools, rope, torches
```

### Search Mode Strategy

**Always Use Search Mode**:
- Detects traps before triggering
- Saves HP and resources
- Slower but much safer

**Thief Leading**:
- Thief has best Find/Remove Traps
- Lead party through dungeon
- Detect before rest of party reaches trap

### Sleep Spell Usage

Most encounters are trivial with Sleep:
- 20 thieves (location 9): Sleep x2 = 8 sleeping
- 10 guards (location 11): Sleep x2 = 8 sleeping
- 8-10 thieves (location 3): Sleep x1 = all sleeping

**Recommendation**: Memorize 3 Sleep spells (handles all major encounters)

### Resource Management

- Thieves are low-threat enemies (save high-level spells)
- Cure Light Wounds sufficient (no Cure Serious needed)
- Traps are bigger threat than combat
- Rest in New Phlan if needed (can return to mansion)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Entering from West Side
**Problem**: Three western doors are fake/locked, waste time
**Solution**: Always enter from north entrance

### 2. Not Using Search Mode
**Problem**: Trigger multiple traps, cumulative damage
**Solution**: Turn on search mode immediately and leave it on

### 3. Equipping Cursed Broad Sword -2
**Problem**: -2 penalty to hit/damage, can't unequip without Remove Curse
**Solution**: Identify as cursed, sell or discard immediately

### 4. Chasing the Fleeing Thieves
**Problem**: Wastes time, southern route leads to ambush anyway
**Solution**: Ignore both fleeing thieves, explore systematically

### 5. Not Scribing Fireball Scroll
**Problem**: Miss opportunity to learn powerful spell early
**Solution**: Have Magic-User scribe Fireball immediately (if INT allows)

### 6. Wasting Leather Armor +4 on Fighter
**Problem**: Fighters have better armor options (plate mail)
**Solution**: Give to thief or magic-user for maximum benefit

### 7. Ignoring Journal Entry 48
**Problem**: Miss critical dragon intelligence for endgame
**Solution**: Read carefully, note dragon type and Tyranthraxus possession

### 8. Leaving Tapestries Behind
**Problem**: Miss 500-800 GP in easy loot
**Solution**: Take if you have carrying capacity, or return later

1. **Leather Armor +4**: Best armor for anyone with DEX 16+; no movement penalty
2. **Short Sword +2**: Perfect backstab weapon for thieves (+4 total THAC0 bonus while backstabbing)
3. **Fireball Scroll**: Must have INT 11+ to scribe; incredibly valuable for future dungeons
4. **Journal Entry 48**: Read carefully; hints that Protection from GOOD is needed for final boss
5. **Valjevo Castle Maps**: Study before attempting final dungeon
6. **Cursed Items**: Always use Identify spell or have cleric cast Detect Evil before equipping unknown weapons
7. **Search Mode**: Slows exploration but saves HP; always worth it in trap-heavy dungeons
