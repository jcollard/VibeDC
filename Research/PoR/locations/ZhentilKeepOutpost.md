# Zhentil Keep Outpost

## Overview

**Recommended Level**: 7-9
**Difficulty**: Hard (Multiple waves, powerful enemies)
**Primary Objective**: Survive the trap, eliminate Zhentarim forces
**Secondary Objectives**: Acquire Gauntlets of Ogre Power, excellent magical equipment
**Completion Requirement**: Defeat all waves including Commandant

**CRITICAL**: This is a **TRAP** set by Councilman Cadorna! The "diplomatic mission" is an ambush!

**IMPORTANT**: Set a **watch after dinner** to minimize ambush damage!

---

## Location Description

The Zhentil Keep Outpost is a fortified military base in the western wilderness, occupied by the Zhentarim (also called "Zhents")—an evil mercenary organization headquartered in Zhentil Keep. Lord Cadorna sends you on a "diplomatic mission" to deliver a message to the Commandant.

What seems like a straightforward diplomatic task is actually an elaborate trap. Cadorna has betrayed you to the Zhentarim, who plan to ambush you after dinner. You'll be attacked in your sleep, forcing you to fight through multiple waves of elite soldiers, culminating in a battle against the Commandant himself.

The outpost offers excellent rewards including Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Plate Mail +2, Long Sword +2, Rings of Fire Resistance, and more.

## The Trap: How It Unfolds

### Step 1: Arrival and Tour

**Initial Encounter**: Peaceful (initially)

**What Happens**:
1. You arrive at Zhentil Keep Outpost with Cadorna's "diplomatic message"
2. Commandant greets you cordially
3. You're given a tour of the fortress
4. Everything seems legitimate

**Tactical Notes**:
- No combat yet
- No indication of trap
- Cadorna's betrayal not yet revealed

---

### Step 2: Dinner in the Mess Hall

**Location**: Mess Hall (3-3)

**Event**: Formal dinner with Commandant and officers

**CRITICAL DIALOGUE OPTION**:
- During dinner conversation, if you **talk about magic**
- Commandant tells story about the **Pool of Radiance**
- **Journal entry unlocked** (important lore)

**What to Do**:
- Accept dinner invitation
- Engage in conversation
- **Ask about magic/Pool of Radiance** (for journal entry)
- Finish dinner

**Tactical Notes**:
- Still peaceful at this point
- Gather information
- No combat during dinner

---

### Step 3: Quarters - THE AMBUSH (CRITICAL DECISION!)

**Location**: Your Quarters (5-5)

**Event**: After dinner, you're escorted to quarters for the night

**CRITICAL CHOICE**: "Do you want to sleep with a watch?"

#### Option A: Sleep with a Watch (CORRECT CHOICE)

**What Happens**:
- One party member stays awake on guard duty
- **Ambush detected early!**
- Party wakes up with **minimal damage**
- Can prepare for combat
- **Much easier fight**

**Benefits**:
- Party starts at full HP
- Can buff before combat (Bless, Prayer)
- Guard character alerts others
- Prepared defensive positions

**RECOMMENDATION**: **ALWAYS SET A WATCH!**

---

#### Option B: Sleep Normally (WRONG CHOICE)

**What Happens**:
- Entire party asleep
- **Zhentarim ambush while sleeping!**
- **Significant damage before combat starts** (2d6+ per character!)
- Party wakes up mid-combat
- **No time to prepare**
- **Much harder fight**

**Penalties**:
- Start combat at 50-70% HP
- No buffs possible
- Surprised condition
- Disorganized formation

**RECOMMENDATION**: **NEVER sleep without a watch!**

---

### Step 4: Multiple Wave Battles

**IMPORTANT**: "Unlike some other places in the game, the waves won't come consecutively"

**What This Means**:
- After each wave, you have **time to rest**
- Can **cast healing spells** between waves
- Can **re-memorize spells** (if you rest)
- Can **save game** between waves
- **NOT a continuous gauntlet like other locations**

**Tactical Advantage**: Use downtime to heal and prepare for next wave!

## Treasure Summary

| Source | Items | Estimated Value |

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Rest Between Waves (CRITICAL MECHANIC)

**Unlike other gauntlet fights**, Zhentil Keep allows resting between waves!

**What to Do Between Each Wave**:
1. **Cure all wounds** (spells or potions)
2. **Re-memorize used spells** (if resting)
3. **Save game** (in case next wave goes badly)
4. **Buff before next wave** (Bless, Prayer ready)
5. **Reorganize equipment** (equip new loot)

**This makes Zhentil Keep much more manageable than continuous gauntlets!**

---

### Hold Person Spam Strategy

**Why Hold Person is Critical**:
- All enemies are humanoid (works on all)
- Bosses have high AC (hard to hit normally)
- Held enemies = auto-hit
- Dramatically reduces battle length

**Recommended Loadout**:
- Each cleric: Hold Person x4-5
- Hold Person scrolls as backup
- Spam on bosses (dwarf, commandant)

---

### Equipment Progression During Quest

**After Wave 4**:
- Equip Gauntlets of Ogre Power on best fighter
- Now deals +6 damage per hit!
- Dramatically improves Wave 5 performance

**After Wave 5**:
- Equip Plate Mail +2 (if better than current)
- Distribute 2x Ring of Fire Resistance
- Give Bracers AC 3 to magic-user
- Save Wand of Lightning for tough fights

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Sleeping Without a Watch
**Problem**: Party takes 2d6+ damage per character before combat, starts at 50% HP
**Solution**: ALWAYS set a watch! Guard detects ambush early

### 2. Not Resting Between Waves
**Problem**: Enter next wave with low HP/no spells
**Solution**: Use downtime to heal and re-memorize spells

### 3. Not Saving Between Waves
**Problem**: Party wipe in Wave 5 = restart from beginning
**Solution**: Save after each successful wave

### 4. Not Equipping Gauntlets After Wave 4
**Problem**: Miss +6 damage bonus for final wave
**Solution**: Immediately equip on best fighter after dwarf dies

### 5. Targeting Bodyguards Before Commandant
**Problem**: Commandant free to attack at AC 0, deals heavy damage
**Solution**: Hold/kill Commandant first, guards are secondary

### 6. Not Bringing Hold Person Spells
**Problem**: Can't hold bosses (dwarf, commandant), fights take much longer
**Solution**: Each cleric memorizes Hold Person x4-5

### 7. Not Talking About Magic at Dinner
**Problem**: Miss Pool of Radiance journal entry (lore)
**Solution**: Engage in conversation, ask about magic

---

- 1-2 Magic-Users (Magic Missile x4, Fireball x2, 18+ HP)
- 1 Thief (optional, 20+ HP)

**Critical Requirements**:
