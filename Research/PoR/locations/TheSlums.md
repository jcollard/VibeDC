# The Slums

## Overview

**Location Type:** Urban dungeon area (outdoors)
**Grid Size:** 18x18
**Recommended Level:** 1-3
**Difficulty:** Easy (first quest area)
**Quest Giver:** City Council Clerk (New Phlan)
**Reward:** 450 XP, 50 platinum

## Background

The Slums were once a thriving residential and commercial district of Phlan. When the city fell to monsters and evil forces, this area was overrun by ogres, trolls, orcs, goblins, and other humanoid creatures. The district has become a lawless wasteland where monsters openly roam and threaten the civilized area of New Phlan.

The City Council has authorized adventurers to clear the Slums of all hostile creatures. This is typically the first major quest undertaken by new adventurers, serving as an introduction to outdoor exploration and tactical combat.

## Description

The Slums consist of ruined and abandoned buildings, broken streets, and debris-filled squares. Former shops, homes, and warehouses now serve as lairs for ogres and trolls. The area is dangerous but navigable, with several distinct encounter locations connected by streets and alleys.

Once cleared, the Slums become a safe resting area (free rest with no cost).

## Tips & Warnings

### Critical Tips
1. **Memorize Sleep spells!** - Most encounters = instant win
2. **Save Stinking Cloud for Location 14** - Essential for trolls/ogres
3. **Search Location 5 thoroughly** - Secret treasure room
4. **Search Location 6 for Ring of Protection +1** - Easy to miss
5. **Save Location 14 for last** - Hardest fight, need experience first

### Common Mistakes
- Attempting Location 14 too early (under-leveled)
- Not bringing Stinking Cloud (makes ogres/trolls very hard)
- Missing secret treasure room (Location 5)
- Missing Ring of Protection +1 (Location 6)
- Not using Sleep spell (wastes other resources)

### Warnings
- **Troll regeneration** - Kill fast or stand on corpse!
- **Ogre damage** - 1d10 can one-shot low-HP characters
- **Location 14 is HARD** - Don't underestimate 4 trolls + 2 ogres

## Historical Background

The Slums were once a working-class district of Phlan, home to dockworkers, craftsmen, and merchants. When Phlan fell to the mysterious evil force, this area was among the first overrun. Ogres and trolls claimed the sturdier buildings as lairs, while smaller humanoids (orcs, goblins, kobolds) scavenged the ruins.

The monsters have created a loose hierarchy with the ogres and trolls as dominant predators, and smaller creatures serving as scouts and scavengers. The "Monster Meeting Place" (Location 7) serves as a gathering point where different groups coordinate (loosely).

Clearing the Slums is the first step in reclaiming Phlan, and success here proves to the City Council that adventurers are capable of taking on more dangerous districts.
