# New Phlan - Civilized Area

## Overview

**Location Type:** Safe City Hub
**Grid Size:** 16x16 (coordinates 0-15, 0-15)
**Danger Level:** Safe (no random encounters)
**Rest Cost:** Varies by inn (5-20 gp)

## Background

New Phlan is the civilized section of the once-great city of Phlan. After the city fell to monsters and evil forces, brave citizens managed to hold and reclaim this small district. It serves as the base of operations for adventurers hired by the City Council to gradually reclaim the rest of Phlan from the monsters that infest it.

The city is organized on a grid system with coordinates (X, Y) where (0,0) is the northwest corner. The horizontal coordinate is listed first, followed by the vertical coordinate.

## Description

The Civilized Area of New Phlan is a walled district containing all the essential services adventurers need: training halls, shops, temples, inns, taverns, and the City Council building. The streets are patrolled by guards, making it the only truly safe area in Phlan.

From here, boats depart to various quest areas including the Slums, Sokal Keep, and wilderness regions. The Passenger Dock in the northeast serves as the primary transit point.

## Historical Background

New Phlan is all that remains of the once-great city of Phlan, a major port on the Moonsea. Decades ago, Phlan was a thriving trade city, but it fell to monsters, undead, and evil forces. The exact cause remains mysterious, though rumors speak of a corrupted "pool of radiance" and a malevolent entity called Tyranthraxus.

A small group of determined citizens managed to hold the northeast section of the city, establishing it as "New Phlan" or the "Civilized Area." The City Council now hires adventurers to gradually reclaim the lost districts, hoping to eventually restore Phlan to its former glory.
