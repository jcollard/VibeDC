# Valjevo Castle - Final Dungeon

## Overview

**Location Type:** Fortress castle (final dungeon)
**Grid Size:** Massive (4 city hexes - multiple quadrants)
**Recommended Level:** 9-10 (ENDGAME)
**Difficulty:** EXTREMELY HARD
**Quest Objective:** Defeat Tyranthraxus (win game)
**Primary Enemies:** High-level fighters, clerics, magic-users, BRONZE DRAGON (final boss)
**Special Feature:** Poisonous hedge maze navigation
**Boss:** Tyranthraxus (possessing bronze dragon) - **IMMUNE TO ALL MAGIC**

## Background

Valjevo Castle stands as an imposing fortress on the outskirts of Phlan, its dark towers visible for miles. Once a noble stronghold defending the city, the castle fell when Tyranthraxus's forces overwhelmed its garrison. The malevolent entity claimed the castle as his seat of power, transforming it into a fortress of evil.

Within the castle walls, Tyranthraxus created a poisonous hedge maze - a deadly labyrinth surrounding the central keep. Only those who navigate the maze can reach the Pool of Radiance chamber where Tyranthraxus awaits in the form of a possessed bronze dragon named Srossar.

**This is the final challenge of Pool of Radiance.** Parties must be at maximum strength, fully equipped, and thoroughly prepared. There is no turning back once the final battles begin.

## Description

Valjevo Castle consists of a series of buildings and towers arranged around a central hub. Massive stone walls enclose the compound, patrolled by powerful enemies. The architecture is imposing - thick walls, narrow windows, and defensive positions throughout.

At the heart of the castle lies a horrifying hedge maze. The hedges are not natural plants but twisted, thorn-covered growth infused with poison. The maze is deliberately confusing, and touching the poisonous plants causes damage. Navigation requires care and patience.

Beyond the maze stands the central keep, a dark tower descending into the earth. Deep below, in a subterranean chamber, lies the Pool of Radiance - a crescent-shaped pool of glowing, corrupted water. Here, Tyranthraxus waits in the body of Srossar, an ancient bronze dragon dominated by the evil entity.

- **FIRE AURA DAMAGES MELEE!** - Resist Fire mandatory

## Historical Background

Valjevo Castle was built centuries ago as Phlan's primary defensive fortress. When invaders threatened, the city's garrison would rally at Valjevo to mount their defense. The castle was considered impregnable - thick walls, strategic position, well-supplied.

When Phlan fell to the corrupting influence of the Pool of Radiance, Valjevo Castle became a primary target. Tyranthraxus's forces laid siege, eventually overwhelming the defenders through sheer numbers and dark magic. The castle fell, and Tyranthraxus claimed it as his seat of power.

The malevolent entity created the poisonous hedge maze around the central keep, both as a defense and as a symbol of corruption. At the maze's heart stands the keep, descending deep into the earth where an ancient dragon lair exists. Here, Tyranthraxus found Srossar, an old bronze dragon who had laired beneath the castle for centuries.

Tyranthraxus possessed Srossar, dominating the good dragon's mind and using its body as a vessel. The Pool of Radiance, brought to this chamber, serves as Tyranthraxus's source of power. From here, the entity commands the forces corrupting Phlan.

Destroying Tyranthraxus in Srossar's body purifies the Pool of Radiance, breaking the entity's hold on Phlan. The city can finally begin true healing, and the heroes who accomplished this feat become legends.

## Final Notes

### The Twist

**Bronze Dragons are Lawful Good:**
- Normally noble, heroic creatures
- Srossar was a good dragon
- Tyranthraxus possesses him against his will
- **Party kills a good creature to stop evil entity**
- Tragic but necessary

**Woman's Warning (Kuto's Well):**
- "Evil spirit from unholy pool"
- "Hides behind fair countenance"
- **Fair countenance = good dragon appearance**
- Foreshadowed this twist!

### Character Transfer

**After Winning:**
- Can transfer characters to **Curse of the Azure Bonds**
- Stats, levels, some equipment carry over
- Continue story in sequel
- Full tetralogy available

### Speedrun Notes

Experienced players can complete Pool of Radiance in 10-20 hours. Castle is final ~2-3 hours.

### Achievement

**Congratulations on completing Pool of Radiance!**
- First Gold Box game conquered
- Classic CRPG mastered
- Ready for sequels
