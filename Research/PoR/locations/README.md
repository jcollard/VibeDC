- **vs. Wights:** Turn Undead preferred (ranged magic if must fight)
- **vs. Mummies:** Ranged magic (Fireball/Lightning), CURE DISEASE IMMEDIATELY after!
- **vs. Vampire:** Use Efreet Bottle (summons ally), buff extensively, kill wolves first

### Valjevo Castle
- **vs. Elite Guards:** Conserve resources! (Hold Person, Stinking Cloud), save high-level spells for dragon
- **vs. Tyranthraxus (Dragon):** Melee ONLY (magic immune!), Protection from GOOD (dragon is good-aligned!), Enlarge fighters (+6 damage), Resist Fire (fire aura), Haste (doubles attacks), heal proactively

## Treasure Hunting Tips

### Secret Doors & Hidden Treasure
- **The Slums Location 5:** Secret treasure room (search walls)
- **Sokal Keep Location 5:** Invisible door in north wall (search thoroughly!)
- **Kuto's Well Location 2:** Behind locked door (defeat lizard guards first)
- **Mendor's Library:** Manual of Bodily Health (search area marked 'M')
- **Valhingen Graveyard Location 15:** Vampire's lair (secret door from northeast building)

### How to Find Secrets
1. Use Search command in suspicious areas
2. Check walls (especially north walls)
3. Look for dead ends or odd room shapes
4. Search near treasure markers on maps

### Best Items to Find
1. **Manual of Bodily Health** (Mendor's Library) - Priceless
2. **Hammer +3** (Valhingen Graveyard Location 9) - Best cleric weapon in game!
3. **Plate Mail +2, Long Sword +2** (Valhingen Graveyard Location 13) - Excellent endgame gear
4. **Bracers AC 4** (Kuto's Well Location 2) - Better than AC 6 from Slums
5. **Mace +2** (Sokal Keep Location 5) - Good cleric weapon
6. **Ring of Protection +1** (Slums Location 6) - AC and saves
7. **Composite Long Bow** (New Phlan shop) - Must purchase (25,000 gp)
