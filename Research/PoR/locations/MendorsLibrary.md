# Mendor's Library

## Overview

**Location Type:** Indoor dungeon (library/building)
**Grid Size:** Medium (multi-level)
**Recommended Level:** 4-6
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
**Quest Giver:** City Council Clerk (New Phlan)
**Reward:** 208 XP, 200 platinum (for returning books)
**Primary Enemies:** Basilisks, Spectres, mixed creatures
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** **BRASS MIRRORS (entire party!)**
**Most Valuable Treasure:** **Manual of Bodily Health** (permanent +1 CON)

## Background

Mendor's Library was once the finest repository of knowledge in Phlan, housing thousands of books, scrolls, and manuscripts on history, magic, and lore. The head librarian, Mendor, was a respected scholar who dedicated his life to preserving knowledge.

When Phlan fell, the library was overrun by monsters seeking shelter among the ancient tomes. Basilisks made their lairs in the reading rooms, their petrifying gaze turning unfortunate intruders to stone. Spectres and other undead haunt the stacks, and various creatures have claimed different sections.

The City Council wants the library's most valuable books returned to preserve Phlan's cultural heritage.

## Description

A multi-story stone building filled with bookshelves, reading desks, and scroll cases. The air smells of old parchment, dust, and decay. Statues line the halls - former adventurers and scholars turned to stone by basilisk gazes. The wooden floors creak ominously, and shadows seem to move independently in the dim light filtering through broken windows.

**WARNING:** Without mirrors, basilisk gazes will petrify (instant death).

## CRITICAL WARNING - BASILISKS

### **BRING BRASS MIRRORS OR DIE!**

**What Happens Without Mirrors:**
1. Encounter basilisk
2. Basilisk uses petrifying gaze
3. Character turns to stone (INSTANT DEATH)
4. Requires Stone to Flesh spell to cure (NOT AVAILABLE in Pool of Radiance)
5. **CHARACTER PERMANENTLY LOST**

**What Happens With Mirrors:**
1. Equip brass mirror (before entering!)
2. Encounter basilisk
3. Mirror automatically reflects gaze
4. **NO PETRIFICATION** (safe!)
5. Fight basilisk normally

### How to Get Mirrors

**Where:** General Goods Store (New Phlan)
**Cost:** ~5-10 gp each (cheap!)
**Required:** One mirror per party member

**BEFORE ENTERING MENDOR'S LIBRARY:**
1. Go to General Goods Store
2. Buy 6 brass mirrors (one per character)
3. **EQUIP mirrors on ALL characters**
4. Verify everyone has mirror equipped
5. THEN enter library

**Mirror Types:**
- **Brass Mirror:** Cheap, works perfectly
- **Silver Mirror:** More expensive, same effect

**Both work equally well!** Buy brass to save money.

## Notes

### Mirror Mechanics

**How Mirrors Work:**
- Equip brass or silver mirror
- Basilisk/Medusa gaze attacks automatically reflected
- No save needed
- No action needed
- **Permanent protection while equipped**

**Mirror Requirements:**
- One per character
- Must be equipped (not just in inventory)
- Brass and silver mirrors work equally

### Manual of Bodily Health Details

**Constitution Increase:**
- Permanent +1 to Constitution
- Increases max HP retroactively
- Better saves (CON affects some)

**HP Calculation:**
- Character gains HP for all past levels
- Example: CON 16→17 = +1 HP per level
- Level 6 character gains 6 HP immediately

**Best Candidates:**
- Character with lowest CON (biggest benefit)
- Fighter (benefits from HP most)
- Long-term character (sequels)

### Energy Drain (Spectres)

**Permanent in Pool of Radiance:**
- Restoration spell not available
- Energy drain cannot be reversed
- Levels lost permanently

**Avoid at All Costs:**
- Turn Undead instead of fighting
- Ranged magic instead of melee
- High AC characters only if must melee

### Experience Rewards

- Basilisks: Good XP
- Spectres: Excellent XP (if you can win safely)
- Quest completion: 208 XP
- Total: Significant for level 4-6 party

### Time Investment
**First playthrough:** 1-2 hours
**Experienced players:** 45-90 minutes

## Tips & Warnings

### CRITICAL Tips
1. **BUY BRASS MIRRORS BEFORE ENTERING!** (one per character)
2. **EQUIP mirrors!** (check each character)
3. **Get Manual of Bodily Health!** (most valuable item in game)
4. **Don't sell Manual!** (use it or save for sequels)
5. **Turn Undead vs. spectres!** (avoid level drain)

### Common Mistakes
- **Entering without mirrors** (basilisks = instant death)
- **Forgetting to equip mirrors** (mirrors must be equipped, not just carried)
- **Missing Manual of Bodily Health** (search thoroughly!)
- **Selling Manual** (priceless item, don't sell!)
- **Fighting spectres in melee** (energy drain is permanent)

### Warnings
- **NO MIRRORS = DEATH** - Basilisk petrification is permanent
- **ENERGY DRAIN IS PERMANENT** - Can't be reversed in Pool of Radiance
- **SPECTRES ARE DANGEROUS** - 2-level drain per hit, avoid melee!
- **MANUAL IS UNIQUE** - Only one per game (unless exploited)

## Historical Background

Mendor's Library was established over a century ago by the scholar Mendor, a half-elf sage devoted to preserving knowledge. The library became the pride of Phlan, housing thousands of volumes on magic, history, geography, and the arts.

When Phlan fell, Mendor and his staff attempted to save the most valuable books. Their fate is unknown, but basilisks now inhabit the reading rooms, and spectres haunt the rare books section - perhaps the spirits of scholars who died protecting their knowledge.

The City Council desperately wants the library's books recovered, both for their cultural value and because they may contain information about Phlan's fall and the corrupted Pool of Radiance.

Among the treasures is the Manual of Bodily Health, a magical tome of incredible value. Why it was in the library (normally such manuals are held by adventurers or nobles) remains a mystery.
