# Yarash's Pyramid

## Overview

**Recommended Level**: 5-7
**Difficulty**: Medium-High (Complex teleporter puzzles)
**Primary Objective**: Defeat Yarash, destroy pollution machinery
**Secondary Objectives**: Rescue captive lizardmen, get "SAVIOR" password, loot three treasure rooms
**Completion Requirement**: Destroy machinery + defeat Yarash

**CRITICAL**: Rescuing lizardmen gives "SAVIOR" password for peaceful resolution at [Lizardman Keep](LizardmanKeep.md)!

## Location Description

Yarash's Pyramid is a mysterious structure in the wilderness where the mad sorcerer Yarash conducts experiments on captured lizardmen. The pyramid is famous (or infamous) for its extensive teleporter puzzle system—a complex network of conditional teleporters that can be manipulated by throwing rocks into them.

Your mission is twofold:
1. Destroy Yarash's pollution machinery (affecting Stojanow River)
2. Eliminate Yarash and his mutant lizardman guards

The pyramid offers significant rewards including excellent magical equipment from three treasure rooms and the "SAVIOR" password needed for a peaceful resolution at Lizardman Keep.

## ASCII Map - Pyramid Level 1 (Simplified)

```
The pyramid uses a complex 3-level teleporter system.
Full mapping would require 3D representation.

Key Concept: Teleporters are CONDITIONAL
- Throw rocks into teleporters to toggle destinations
- Each teleporter can send you to 2+ different locations
- Rock-throwing resets the teleporter's target

Example Teleporter:
Location #2 → Can go to #8a OR #8b
- Throw rock → switches between #8a and #8b
- Step in teleporter → go to currently set destination
```

**Critical Teleporter Shortcuts**:
- Specific rock-throwing sequences let you "skip almost all of level one"
- Avoid many high-level creature encounters
- Reach important areas (password door, machinery, Yarash) faster

---

## Teleporter Puzzle System

### How Teleporters Work

**Conditional Teleporters**:
1. Each teleporter has 2+ possible destinations
2. **Throw rocks** into teleporter to change destination
3. **Step into teleporter** to travel to current destination
4. Experiment with rock-throwing to learn destinations

**Example**:
```
Teleporter at Location #2:
- Default: Goes to #8a
- Throw rock: Now goes to #8b
- Throw rock again: Back to #8a
```

### Strategy for Navigation

**Trial and Error Method** (Time-Consuming):
1. Enter teleporter, note where it sends you
2. Return, throw rock into teleporter
3. Enter again, note new destination
4. Map out all destinations
5. Use rocks to set desired destination
6. Enter to travel

**Speedrun Method** (Advanced):
1. Use known rock-throwing sequences
2. Skip most of level 1 encounters
3. Reach level 2 quickly
4. Proceed directly to objectives

**RECOMMENDATION**: First-time players should explore normally. Speedrunners can use shortcuts after learning the layout.

## Key Locations and Encounters

### Level 1: Entry and Teleporter Maze

**Random Encounters**: High-level creatures (can be avoided with teleporter shortcuts)

**Tactical Notes**:
- Many encounters can be skipped
- Learn teleporter patterns to avoid combat
- Save spell slots for Yarash boss fight

---

### Level 2: Password Door and Machinery

#### Location #14: Password Door

**Description**: A door with Dwarvish runes requiring a password to open.

**Password**: **"NOKNOK"** (or "NOTNOW" in Commodore 64 version)

**How to Discover**:
- Read Dwarvish rune hints (requires dwarf in party or Read Languages spell)
- Trial and error
- Consult this guide!

**What Password Means**: Dwarvish phrase (roughly "not now" or similar)

**Entry**:
- Approach door
- Speak password: **"NOKNOK"**
- Door opens

**Beyond Door**: Leads to Machinery Room (#15) and path to Yarash

---

#### Location #15: Machinery Room (MAIN OBJECTIVE)

**Description**: A large room filled with Yarash's pollution equipment affecting the Stojanow River.

**Objective**: Destroy all machinery

**How to Do It**:
1. Enter machinery room
2. **Attack the machinery** (treat as objects)
3. Machinery breaks
4. **IMMEDIATELY RUN OUT OF ROOM!**
5. **Tremendous explosion occurs!**

**CRITICAL WARNING**: **LEAVE ROOM IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKING MACHINERY!**

- Massive explosion (10d6+ damage to all party members!)
- Potential party wipe
- You were warned!

**What Happens If You Leave**:
- Explosion contained to machinery room
- No damage to party
- Quest objective complete

**Tactical Strategy**:
1. Save before entering machinery room
2. Attack machinery
3. **Run to exit immediately**
4. Wait for explosion outside room
5. Check quest log (machinery destroyed)

---

#### Location #16: Captured Lizardmen (CRITICAL FOR LIZARDMAN KEEP!)

**Description**: A prison chamber where Yarash keeps captured lizardmen for experiments.

**Encounter**: Peaceful (lizardmen are prisoners)

**Importance**: **EXTREMELY HIGH!**

**What to Do**:
1. Find captured lizardmen
2. **Parley/talk with them** (choose friendly dialogue)
3. Free them from captivity
4. Lizardmen are grateful
5. **Lizardmen give you the codeword: "SAVIOR"**

**What "SAVIOR" Password Does**:
- Used at [Lizardman Keep](LizardmanKeep.md)
- Allows peaceful resolution with lizardman chief
- Avoids all combat at Lizardman Keep
- **ESSENTIAL for easy Lizardman Keep quest!**

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT miss this! Talk to lizardmen and get "SAVIOR" password!

---

### Level 3: Yarash Boss Fight

#### Location #17: Yarash and Mutant Lizardmen

**Description**: The final chamber where Yarash the mad sorcerer awaits with his mutant lizardman bodyguards.

**Boss**: Yarash (Evil Magic-User)

**Enemy Composition**:
```
YARASH (BOSS MAGIC-USER)
- HD: 8d4 HP (~20 HP)
- AC: 10 (Robes) - may have Shield spell (AC 6)
- THAC0: 16
- Damage: 1d4 (Dagger)
- Spells: Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Magic Missile, Shield, Mirror Image, Web
- Special: Can cast devastating 3rd-level spells!
- XP: 2,000

MUTANT LIZARDMEN (x2-3)
- HD: 3d8 HP (~18 HP each)
- AC: 5 (Mutated scales)
- THAC0: 16
- Damage: 1d6 / 1d6 (enhanced claws) or 1d8 (weapon)
- Special: Yarash's experiments made them stronger
- XP: 120 each
```

**Why This Fight Is Dangerous**:
- **Yarash can cast Fireball** (10d6 damage to multiple party members!)
- **Lightning Bolt** (10d6 in a line!)
- **Shield spell** (improves AC to 6)
- **Mirror Image** (creates duplicates, hard to hit)
- Mutant lizardmen protect him (must get through them first)

**Tactical Strategy**:

1. **Pre-Combat Buffs** (MANDATORY):
   - Bless (all party)
   - Prayer (if available)
   - Resist Fire (ALL characters - blocks Fireball!)
   - Protection from Evil (front-line)
   - Haste (if available)

2. **Opening Round** - KILL YARASH IMMEDIATELY:
   - **All Magic Missile spells at Yarash** (2-3 magic-users = 6d4+6 damage = ~21 HP)
   - **This likely kills Yarash instantly!** (He only has ~20 HP!)
   - **DO NOT target mutants first** (Yarash can Fireball your party!)

3. **Alternative Opening** - Use Your Own Fireball:
   - **Cast Fireball at grouped enemies** (hits Yarash + mutants)
   - 10d6 damage (avg ~35 damage)
   - Yarash dies instantly
   - Mutants heavily damaged or dead

4. **If Yarash Survives Round 1** (Emergency):
   - He will cast Fireball or Lightning Bolt (10d6 damage!)
   - Hope Resist Fire is active (halves damage)
   - Heal immediately after
   - Focus all attacks on Yarash round 2

5. **After Yarash Dies**:
   - Mutant lizardmen are standard melee enemies
   - 18 HP each, AC 5
   - Focus fire one at a time
   - Standard cleanup

**Expected Outcome with Fireball**:
- "The 'fireball' spell makes this a pretty easy battle"
- Round 1: Your Fireball kills Yarash + damages mutants
- Rounds 2-3: Clean up mutants
- Total: 3-4 rounds

**Expected Outcome with Magic Missile**:
- Round 1: Magic Missiles kill Yarash
- Rounds 2-4: Kill mutants in melee
- Total: 4-5 rounds

**Loot from Yarash** (EXCELLENT):
- **Bracers AC 4** (AC -4 bonus, great for magic-users!)
- **Potion of Healing x2**
- **Wand of Paralyzation** (paralyzes enemies, charged)
- **Potion of Speed** (equivalent to Haste spell)

**CRITICAL**: Bracers AC 4 are excellent for magic-users (AC 10 → AC 6 with bracers + DEX!)

---

### Location #19: Treasure Dial and Three Treasure Rooms

**Description**: After defeating Yarash, you find a dial control mechanism that accesses three secret treasure chambers.

**How It Works**:
1. Find dial control (near Yarash's lair)
2. **Turn dial to setting 1, 2, or 3**
3. **Teleporter activates** to corresponding treasure room
4. Enter teleporter
5. Loot treasure room
6. Return via same teleporter
7. **Turn dial to next setting** (access other rooms)

**Three Treasure Rooms**:

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Pre-Pyramid Preparation

```
MEMORIZE:
- Magic-Users: Fireball x2-3 (CRITICAL for Yarash!), Magic Missile x3, Sleep x2
- Clerics: Cure Light Wounds x3, Resist Fire x2-3 (CRITICAL!), Bless, Prayer
- Prepare: Healing Potions (3-4 per character)

CRITICAL SPELL: Fireball!
- Makes Yarash fight "pretty easy"
- 10d6 damage kills Yarash instantly
- Damages mutant lizardmen simultaneously
- DO NOT attempt without Fireball or heavy Magic Missile!
```

### Yarash Boss Fight Priority

**Phase 1: Kill Yarash (Round 1)**
- Option A: Fireball at enemy group (kills Yarash, damages mutants)
- Option B: All Magic Missile at Yarash (6d4+6 = ~21 damage, kills him)
- **DO NOT target mutants first!** (Yarash will Fireball your party!)

**Phase 2: Clean Up Mutants (Rounds 2-4)**
- Standard melee/ranged attacks
- 18 HP each, AC 5
- Focus fire one at a time

### Teleporter Navigation Tips

**First-Time Players**:
- Explore methodically
- Map teleporter destinations
- Use rocks to learn patterns
- Fight some encounters for XP

**Speedrunners**:
- Use known teleporter sequences
- Skip most level 1 encounters
- Reach objectives quickly
- Save time and spell slots

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Killing Yarash First
**Problem**: Yarash casts Fireball (10d6 to multiple party members!)
**Solution**: ALL attacks on Yarash round 1 (Fireball or Magic Missile)

### 2. Staying in Machinery Room After Breaking Equipment
**Problem**: Tremendous explosion deals 10d6+ damage, potential party wipe
**Solution**: IMMEDIATELY run out after attacking machinery

### 3. Not Talking to Captured Lizardmen
**Problem**: Miss "SAVIOR" password, forced into hard combat at Lizardman Keep
**Solution**: Always parley with captive lizardmen, get password

### 4. Not Casting Resist Fire Before Yarash
**Problem**: Yarash's Fireball deals full 10d6 damage (avg 35 HP!)
**Solution**: Cast Resist Fire on all party members (halves to ~17 HP)

### 5. Forgetting to Loot All Three Treasure Rooms
**Problem**: Miss Ring of Fire Resistance and Long Sword +2
**Solution**: Use dial to access all three rooms (settings 1, 2, 3)

### 6. Attacking Machinery Without Saving First
**Problem**: If you don't run fast enough, explosion wipes party, lose progress
**Solution**: Save before machinery room, run immediately after attacking

### 7. Not Bringing Fireball Spell
**Problem**: Yarash fight becomes much harder without it
**Solution**: Level 5+ Magic-Users must memorize Fireball x2-3

---

## Recommended Party Level and Composition

**Minimum Level**: 5 (need Fireball access!)
**Recommended Level**: 6-7
**Comfortable Level**: 7-8

**Ideal Party**:
- 2-3 Fighters (AC 2-3, +1 weapons, 35+ HP each)
- 1-2 Clerics (Resist Fire x2-3, Cure Light x3, Bless, Prayer, 22+ HP)
- **1-2 Magic-Users (Fireball x2-3, Magic Missile x3, 15+ HP) - CRITICAL!**
- 1 Thief (backstab, 18+ HP)

**Critical Requirements**:
- **Magic-User level 5+** (access to Fireball spell!)
- **Fireball memorized x2** (one for Yarash, one backup)
- Resist Fire (clerics x2-3 memorized)
- Total party HP: 140+ combined
- Average AC: 3 or better

**Without Fireball**: Level 7-8 minimum (can use Magic Missile spam instead, but harder)
