# Stojanow Gate

## Overview

**Recommended Level**: 5-6
**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard (Tactical battle with mages and ettins)
**Primary Objective**: Capture Stojanow Gate from bugbear control
**Secondary Objectives**: Defeat both tower guards, secure rings of protection +2
**Completion Requirement**: Defeat bugbear patrol + both towers (or negotiate passage)

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Purchasing the **supply cart for 250 GP** splits one massive battle into three manageable fights!

---

## Location Description

Stojanow Gate is a fortified checkpoint on the outskirts of New Phlan, currently occupied by bugbears and their allies. The gate consists of an outer gate, inner gate, and two guard towers, each defended by powerful enemies including ettins (two-headed giants) and high-level magic-users.

Your mission is to reclaim the gate for New Phlan, either through direct assault or clever use of disguise (via a supply cart purchase). This is one of the most tactical battles in the early-to-mid game, requiring careful spell usage and positioning.

```

## Two Approaches: Direct Assault vs. Supply Cart

### Approach A: Direct Assault (No Cart)

**Cost**: 0 GP

**Process**:
1. Fight bugbear patrol at location 2 (10-15 bugbears)
2. Bash outer gate while being bombarded with rocks/arrows
3. Bash inner gate while being bombarded with rocks/arrows
4. **Fight combined final battle**: 2 aides, 2 level-6 mages, 6 ettins ALL AT ONCE

**Pros**:
- Free (no 250 GP cost)
- Faster if you can survive

**Cons**:
- Extremely difficult final battle (10 enemies simultaneously!)
- High casualty risk
- Heavy spell/HP expenditure
- Bombardment damage while bashing gates

**Recommended For**: High-level parties (7+), experienced players, parties with excellent AOE spells

---

### Approach B: Supply Cart Purchase (RECOMMENDED)

**Cost**: 250 GP (one-time)

**Process**:
1. Buy supply cart from seller at location 1 (250 GP)
2. Approach bugbear patrol disguised as supplier
3. Pay 15 GP toll (bugbears let you through peacefully)
4. Enter gate complex without bashing
5. Fight final battle: 2 aides, 2 level-6 mages, 6 ettins
6. Separately clear west tower: 1 mage, 1 aide, 3 ettins
7. Separately clear east tower: 1 mage, 1 aide, 3 ettins

**Pros**:
- Splits one 10-enemy battle into three 4-5 enemy battles (much easier!)
- No bombardment damage
- No gate-bashing required
- Bypass bugbear patrol combat
- Lower casualty risk
- Better action economy

**Cons**:
- Costs 250 GP upfront + 15 GP toll
- Slightly longer overall

**Recommended For**: All parties level 5-7, first-time players, tactical approach

**CRITICAL**: The 250 GP cost is ABSOLUTELY worth it to avoid the combined 10-enemy battle!

---

## Key Locations and Encounters

### Location 1: Supply Cart Seller (3-1)

**Description**: A merchant offering to sell you a supply cart for use as a disguise.

**Offer**: Supply cart for **250 Gold Pieces**

**What the Cart Does**:
- Disguises your party as legitimate suppliers
- Bugbears accept you as friendly
- Pay only 15 GP toll instead of fighting
- Avoid gate-bashing bombardment
- **Splits final battle into three separate fights**

**Tactical Value**: **EXTREMELY HIGH**

Comparison:
- **Without cart**: Fight 10 enemies at once (2 mages, 2 aides, 6 ettins)
- **With cart**: Fight 5 + 4 + 4 enemies in separate battles (much easier)

**RECOMMENDATION**: **BUY THE CART!** 250 GP is a small price for massively easier battles.

---

### Location 2: Bugbear Patrol (3-4)

**Description**: A checkpoint manned by bugbears who inspect all approaching travelers.

**Enemy Composition**: 10-15 Bugbears

**Enemy Stats**:
```
BUGBEARS (x10-15)
- HD: 3+1d8 HP (~16 HP each)
- AC: 5 (Hide Armor)
- THAC0: 16
- Damage: 2d4 (Morning Star) or 1d6 (Javelin)
- XP: 120 each
```

**Two Outcomes**:

#### Outcome A: With Supply Cart (PEACEFUL)
- Bugbears recognize cart
- Request 15 GP toll
- Let party pass peacefully
- **No combat!**

#### Outcome B: Without Supply Cart (COMBAT)
- Bugbears identify party as "imposters"
- Immediate combat with 10-15 bugbears
- Medium difficulty (bugbears have 16 HP each)

**Tactical Strategy** (If Fighting):

1. **Pre-Combat Buffs**:
   - Bless (Clerics)
   - Prayer (if available)

2. **Opening Round**:
   - **Sleep spell DOES NOT WORK** (bugbears have 3 HD)
   - **Hold Person** (clerics, affects 1d4 bugbears)
   - **Fireball** (if available, damages all)
   - **Magic Missile** (guaranteed hits)

3. **Melee Phase**:
   - Focus fire one bugbear at a time (16 HP each)
   - Use chokepoints if possible
   - Keep clerics ready to heal

**Loot**: Bugbear equipment, small treasure

**RECOMMENDATION**: Buy the cart and avoid this fight entirely!

---

### Locations 3-4: The Gates

#### Location 3: Outer Gate (3-6)

**Description**: The first gate blocking entry to the inner courtyard.

**Bombardment**: Rocks and arrows rain down from towers while you attempt to bash.

**Requirements**:
- **High Strength to bash** (18+ recommended)
- **Multiple attempts** may be required
- **Take damage from bombardment** (2d6 per round)

**With Supply Cart**: Gate opens automatically (no bashing required)

**Without Supply Cart**:
1. Order strongest character to bash
2. Take 2d6 damage per round from rocks/arrows
3. Multiple STR checks may be required
4. Gate eventually breaks open

**Tactical Notes**:
- Have healing ready
- Bashers should have high HP
- Ranged attacks from towers can't be stopped

---

#### Location 4: Inner Gate (8-6)

**Description**: The second gate, deeper into the complex.

**Similar to Outer Gate**:
- Requires bashing (18 STR recommended)
- Bombardment damage (2d6 per round)
- Multiple attempts possible

**Critical Difference**: After breaking this gate, you trigger the final battle!

**With Supply Cart**: Bypassed entirely

**Without Supply Cart**: Triggers combined 10-enemy battle immediately after bashing through

---

### Location 4 (Inner Courtyard): Final Battle - Combined Forces

**THIS ENCOUNTER ONLY OCCURS IF YOU DID NOT BUY THE SUPPLY CART!**

**Description**: The main defensive force of Stojanow Gate attacks all at once.

**Enemy Composition** (10 ENEMIES):
```
LEVEL 6 MAGIC-USERS (x2)
- HD: 6d4 HP (~15 HP each)
- AC: 10 (Robes)
- THAC0: 18
- Damage: 1d4 (Dagger)
- Spells: Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Magic Missile, Shield, Mirror Image
- Special: Can cast devastating AOE spells!
- XP: 975 each

FIGHTER AIDES (x2)
- HD: 4d10 HP (~22 HP each)
- AC: 3 (Chain Mail +1, Shield)
- THAC0: 17
- Damage: 1d8+1 (Long Sword +1)
- XP: 120 each

ETTINS (x6)
- HD: 10d8 HP (~45 HP each!)
- AC: 3 (Thick Hide)
- THAC0: 10
- Damage: 2d8 (two attacks per round with clubs!)
- Special: Two-headed = immune to Sleep, Charm
- Special: Attack TWICE per round
- XP: 1,400 each
```

**Total Enemy HP**: ~450+ HP combined!
**Total Enemy XP**: 11,610 XP (if you win)

**Why This Fight Is EXTREMELY HARD**:
- 10 enemies acting simultaneously
- 2 mages can cast Fireball/Lightning Bolt (10d6 damage to multiple party members!)
- 6 ettins have 45 HP EACH and attack twice per round (4d8 damage potential per ettin!)
- Mages have defensive spells (Shield, Mirror Image)
- Action economy heavily favors enemies
- Healing can't keep up with damage output

**Tactical Strategy** (EMERGENCY):

If you're stuck in this fight without the cart:

1. **Pre-Combat Buffs** (MANDATORY):
   - Bless (all party)
   - Prayer (all party)
   - Resist Fire (all party if available - blocks Fireball!)
   - Protection from Evil (front-line fighters)
   - Haste (if available - doubles attacks)

2. **Opening Round - KILL THE MAGES FIRST**:
   - **All Magic Missile spells at mages** (2d4+2 each, auto-hit)
   - **All ranged attacks at mages** (AC 10, easy to hit)
   - **DO NOT target ettins first** (mages are bigger threat!)

3. **Spell Priority**:
   - Magic Missile (mages)
   - Haste (your party if available)
   - Hold Person (aides, NOT ettins)
   - Cure Serious Wounds (as needed)

4. **Melee Phase**:
   - After mages die, focus one ettin at a time (45 HP each)
   - Heal anyone below 20 HP immediately
   - Keep fighters in front (high AC)

5. **Expected Casualties**:
   - 1-2 party members may die
   - Be ready to resurrect in New Phlan
   - Have Raise Dead funds ready

**Loot** (If you survive):
- **2x Ring of Protection +2** (from towers - still need to clear)
- Mage equipment
- Fighter equipment
- Ettin treasure

**CRITICAL**: This fight is designed to be nearly impossible without the cart. BUY THE CART!

---

### Approach B Alternative: Three Separate Battles (WITH SUPPLY CART)

**IF YOU BOUGHT THE SUPPLY CART**, you fight three separate battles instead of one combined battle:

---

#### Battle 1: Inner Courtyard (4 Enemies)

**Enemy Composition**:
- 2 Level 6 Magic-Users
- 2 Fighter Aides

**Enemy Stats**: Same as combined battle (see above)

**Tactical Strategy**:

1. **Pre-Combat Buffs**:
   - Bless (all party)
   - Prayer (if available)
   - Protection from Evil (front-line)

2. **Opening Round**:
   - **All Magic Missile spells at one mage** (focus fire)
   - **All ranged attacks at same mage**
   - **Kill first mage round 1** (only 15 HP)

3. **Round 2**:
   - **Kill second mage** (same strategy)
   - Hold Person on aides (if needed)

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Aides are easy (22 HP, AC 3)
   - Standard melee

**Expected Difficulty**: Medium (manageable with proper focus fire)

**Loot**: Mage scrolls/equipment, fighter equipment

---

#### Battle 2: West Tower (Location 5) - 4 Enemies

**Enemy Composition**:
- 1 Level 6 Magic-User
- 1 Fighter Aide
- 3 Ettins

**Enemy Stats**: Same as combined battle

**Tactical Strategy**:

1. **Pre-Combat Buffs**:
   - Bless
   - Prayer
   - Enlarge (on best fighter for ettin damage)

2. **Opening Round**:
   - **Kill the mage immediately** (Magic Missile + ranged)
   - Ignore ettins until mage is dead

3. **After Mage Dies**:
   - Focus one ettin at a time (45 HP each)
   - Have clerics ready to heal (ettins hit HARD - 4d8!)

4. **Melee Phase**:
   - All melee on single ettin
   - Kill one ettin per 2-3 rounds
   - Keep HP above 20 on all characters

**Expected Difficulty**: Medium-Hard (ettins are tough but manageable one at a time)

**Loot**: **Ring of Protection +2** (EXCELLENT!), mage equipment, ettin treasure

---

#### Battle 3: East Tower (Location 6) - 4 Enemies

**Identical to Battle 2**:
- 1 Level 6 Magic-User
- 1 Fighter Aide
- 3 Ettins

**Tactical Strategy**: Same as West Tower

**Loot**: **Ring of Protection +2** (second one!), mage equipment, ettin treasure

---

## Rings of Protection +2 (MAJOR TREASURE)

**Each tower yields one Ring of Protection +2!**

**Stats**:
- AC: -2 bonus (stacks with armor!)
- Saving Throws: +2 bonus (to ALL saves!)
- Usable by: All classes
- Doesn't stack with other protection rings

**Tactical Value**: **EXTREMELY HIGH**

Example:
- Fighter with AC 2 (Plate Mail +1)
- Equips Ring of Protection +2
- New AC: 0 (2 - 2 = 0)
- Also gains +2 to all saving throws!

**Recommendation**: Give both rings to your main tank fighters for AC 0-1.

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Pre-Battle Preparation

```
MEMORIZE (Supply Cart Route):
- Magic-Users: Magic Missile x3-4, Fireball x1, Shield
- Clerics: Cure Serious Wounds x2, Cure Light Wounds x2, Bless, Prayer
- Prepare: Healing Potions (3-4 per character)
- Equipment: Best weapons (+1 or better), AC 3 or better

MEMORIZE (Direct Assault Route):
- Magic-Users: Magic Missile x4, Fireball x2, Haste
- Clerics: Cure Serious Wounds x3, Resist Fire x2-3, Bless, Prayer
- Prepare: Healing Potions (5-6 per character)
- Equipment: Best gear, have Raise Dead funds ready
```

### Focus Fire Priority

**ALWAYS KILL IN THIS ORDER**:
1. **Mages** (can one-shot entire party with Fireball)
2. **Aides** (moderate threat, 22 HP)
3. **Ettins** (high HP but melee only, kill one at a time)

### Ettin Combat Tactics

**Ettin Threat Level**: Very High

- 45 HP each (takes 3-4 rounds to kill)
- Attacks twice per round (2d8 each attack = 4d8 total!)
- AC 3 (moderately hard to hit)
- Immune to Sleep/Charm (two brains!)

**How to Fight Ettins**:
1. **All melee focus one ettin** (don't split damage)
2. **Keep HP above 20** (ettin max damage: 16 per attack!)
3. **Use Enlarge** (fighters get +6 damage = kill faster)
4. **Heal proactively** (don't wait until <10 HP)

**Expected Time**: 2-3 rounds per ettin with full party focus

---

## Treasure Summary

| Bugbears (if fought) | Morning stars, hide armor, coins | 300-500 GP |

**Total Estimated Value**: ~13,000-15,000 GP

**Best Items**: **2x Ring of Protection +2** (most valuable loot in mid-game!)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Buying the Supply Cart
**Problem**: Face combined 10-enemy battle (2 mages, 2 aides, 6 ettins)
**Solution**: ALWAYS buy the cart for 250 GP (saves lives and resources)

### 2. Targeting Ettins Before Mages
**Problem**: Mages cast Fireball/Lightning Bolt, party-wipe potential
**Solution**: Ignore ettins completely until all mages are dead

### 3. Not Buffing Before Each Battle
**Problem**: Lower hit chance, lower damage, higher casualties
**Solution**: Always cast Bless + Prayer before combat

### 4. Fighting Ettins Without Healing Ready
**Problem**: Ettins deal 4d8 damage per round (up to 32!), can one-shot characters
**Solution**: Keep all characters above 20 HP, have Cure Serious ready

### 5. Splitting Damage Across Multiple Ettins
**Problem**: All ettins stay alive longer, more total damage to party
**Solution**: Focus all attacks on one ettin at a time (kill in 2-3 rounds)

### 6. Not Using Enlarge on Fighters
**Problem**: Miss out on +6 damage bonus (kills ettins much faster)
**Solution**: Cast Enlarge on all fighters before major battles

### 7. Forgetting to Loot Both Towers
**Problem**: Miss one of the Rings of Protection +2
**Solution**: Clear both west AND east towers completely

---

## Recommended Party Level and Composition

**Minimum Level**: 4-5 (with cart, very difficult)
**Recommended Level**: 5-6 (with cart)
**Required Level**: 7+ (without cart)

**Ideal Party**:
- 2-3 Fighters (AC 2-3, +1 weapons, 35+ HP each)
- 1-2 Clerics (Cure Serious, Bless, Prayer, 22+ HP)
- 1-2 Magic-Users (Magic Missile x3-4, Fireball, 15+ HP)
- 1 Thief (optional, 18+ HP)

- Magic-Users with Magic Missile x3+ memorized
- Clerics with Cure Serious Wounds x2 memorized
- Total party HP: 150+ combined
- Average AC: 3 or better

**With Supply Cart**: Level 5-6 parties can succeed

---

## Loot Checklist

- [ ] Supply Cart (Location 1) - 250 GP purchase (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] Ring of Protection +2 (West Tower - Location 5) - CRITICAL
- [ ] Ring of Protection +2 (East Tower - Location 6) - CRITICAL
- [ ] Long Sword +1 x2 (Aides)
- [ ] Chain Mail +1 x2 (Aides)
- [ ] Magic scrolls (Mages)
- [ ] Coins and gems (Ettins, ~1,000 GP total)
- [ ] Bugbear loot (if fought)

---

## After Completing Stojanow Gate

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Return to New Phlan
2. Resurrect any dead party members (if needed)
3. Report to Council (quest reward)
4. **Equip both Rings of Protection +2** (main tanks for AC 0-1)
5. Sell unwanted loot (~3,000-5,000 GP)
6. Train to level up
7. Memorize spells for next location

**Recommended Next Locations**:
- **Level 6-7**: [Temple of Bane](TempleOfBane.md) - Cleanse evil temple
- **Level 6-7**: [Kovel Mansion](KovelMansion.md) - Thieves guild HQ
- **Level 7-8**: [Valhingen Graveyard](ValhingenGraveyard.md) - Dangerous undead

---

## Notes and Tips

1. **Supply Cart**: 250 GP is the best investment in the entire game (splits 10-enemy fight into three 4-5 enemy fights)
2. **Rings of Protection +2**: Among the best items in the game; AC -2 AND +2 saves
3. **Ettins**: Very dangerous (45 HP, attack twice); always kill mages first
4. **Mage Spells**: Level 6 mages have Fireball (10d6 = avg 35 damage to multiple targets!) - MUST kill them immediately
5. **Gate Bashing**: Requires 18 STR and multiple attempts; cart bypasses entirely
6. **Bombardment Damage**: 2d6 per round adds up; cart avoids this completely
7. **Multiple Visits**: You can leave and return to rest/resupply if needed
8. **Hold Person**: Works on aides but NOT ettins (two-headed = two brains = immunity)
