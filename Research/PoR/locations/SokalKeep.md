## Background

Sokal Keep (also spelled "Sokol Keep") was once a proud fortress defending Phlan from external threats. When the city fell, the keep's defenders were slaughtered and rose as undead, cursed to haunt the halls they once protected. The keep now serves as a stronghold for undead creatures and evil NPCs who use the location as a base.

The defenders' ghosts sometimes remember their former duty and can be reasoned with using specific Elvish keywords found within the keep. These spirits hold tragic memories of the keep's fall to "unblessed creatures imbued with the might of a magical pool."

## Description

Sokal Keep is a stone fortress with multiple rooms, corridors, and chambers. The interior is dark, damp, and filled with the smell of decay. Undead wander the halls, and the spirits of former defenders haunt the corridors. Some areas contain valuable weapons caches and equipment left behind when the keep fell.

The atmosphere is oppressive, with spectral moans echoing through chambers and cold drafts flowing through broken windows. Despite the horror, the keep's structure remains largely intact, offering tactical opportunities for clever adventurers.

### How to Use Keywords

**Speaking "LUX"** to certain undead/ghosts:

## Notes

### Turn Undead Strategy

**Critical Ability:** Clerics can Turn Undead (frighten/destroy undead)

**How It Works:**
- Cleric uses Turn Undead action
- All undead in range must check
- Turned undead flee or cower
- Level 6+ clerics **DESTROY** undead (don't just turn)

**Turn Undead Table (relevant):**
| Cleric Level | Skeleton | Zombie |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| 1-2          | 10+      | 13+    |
| 3-4          | 7+       | 10+    |
| 5-6          | T        | 7+     |

**T = Automatic Turn** (no roll needed)

**Strategy:**
- Use Turn Undead liberally (free action!)
- Level 3+ auto-turns skeletons
- Turned undead are helpless
- Saves HP and spell slots

### Keywords vs. Combat

**Using "LUX" (Peaceful):**
- Pros: Save HP/spells, gain lore, receive gems
- Cons: Less combat XP

**Fighting (Combat):**
- Pros: Combat XP, standard loot
- Cons: Use HP/spells, risk character death

**Recommendation:** Use "LUX" (peaceful resolution)
- Resource conservation important for long dungeon crawls
- Gems have good value
- Lore is valuable for story understanding
- Can level up from other encounters

### Weapon Types vs. Undead

**Blunt Weapons (Hammers, Maces, Clubs):**
- Full damage to undead

**Edged Weapons (Swords, Axes):**
- **Half damage** to skeletons/zombies

**Magical Weapons:**
- Full damage regardless of type
- Required for some high-level undead

**Strategy:** Use blunt weapons on undead when possible.

### Experience Rewards

**Encounter XP:** Varies by enemy
**Quest Completion:** 1,308 XP
**Total:** Enough for level 3-4 party to level up

### Time Investment
**First playthrough:** 1-2 hours
**Experienced players:** 45-90 minutes

## Tips & Warnings

### Critical Tips
1. **Read Location 1 parchment FIRST!** - Get keywords
2. **Use "LUX"** with ghosts (save resources)

### Common Mistakes
- Missing keywords at Location 1 (makes ghosts harder)
- Not searching north wall at Location 5 (miss Mace +2!)
- Entering Location 7 room (surrounded by enemies)

- **Search Location 5 north wall!** - Mace +2 is easy to miss
- **Bring blunt weapons!** - Swords do half damage to undead
- **Read keywords!** - Makes keep much easier

## Historical Background

Sokal Keep was built centuries ago as a defensive fortress for Phlan, protecting the city from Moonsea raiders and wilderness threats. The keep housed an elite garrison of fighters, clerics, and defenders sworn to protect Phlan at all costs.

When the mysterious corruption swept through Phlan, the keep's defenders made a desperate last stand. They fought valiantly but were overwhelmed by "unblessed creatures imbued with the might of a magical pool" - servants of Tyranthraxus empowered by the corrupted Pool of Radiance.

The slain defenders rose as undead, cursed to haunt the keep they died protecting. Some, like Ferran Martinez, retain fragments of their former honor and can be reached with the Elvish words of respect: "Lux," "Samosud," and "Shestni."

The keep stands as a tragic monument to Phlan's fall and the corrupting power of the Pool of Radiance.
