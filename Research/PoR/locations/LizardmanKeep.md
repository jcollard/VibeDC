# Lizardman Keep (Ruined Castle)

## Overview

**Recommended Level**: 4-6
**Difficulty**: Medium (Easy if you have "SAVIOR" password)
**Primary Objective**: Prevent lizardmen from joining Tyranthraxus
**Secondary Objectives**: Loot treasure pools, acquire Shields +2
**Completion Requirement**: Resolve leadership challenge or defeat all lizardmen

**CRITICAL**: **ANTI-MAGIC SHELL** covers entire keep - NO SPELLCASTING ALLOWED!

**IMPORTANT**: Get the "SAVIOR" password from [Yarash's Pyramid](YarashPyramid.md) FIRST for peaceful resolution!

---

## Location Description

The Lizardman Keep is an abandoned castle in the northeastern wilderness, now occupied by a tribe of lizardmen led by an elderly chieftain. The keep is surrounded by swamp, quicksand, and forest, making approach treacherous.

Your mission is to prevent the lizardmen from allying with Tyranthraxus. You can achieve this through:
1. **Peaceful resolution** (if you have "SAVIOR" password from Yarash's Pyramid)
2. **Champion the elderly chief** in a duel against Drythh (young challenger)
3. **Combat** (wipe out all lizardmen)

The most important tactical consideration: The entire keep is covered by an **ANTI-MAGIC SHELL** that prevents ALL spellcastingâ€”no magic, no clerical spells, nothing! This is a pure melee/ranged weapon fight.

## CRITICAL: Anti-Magic Shell

**THE MOST IMPORTANT MECHANIC IN THIS LOCATION!**

### What Is It?
An **anti-magic shell** is a magical field that suppresses ALL magic within its area.

### What It Does:
- **NO spellcasting** (magic-users can't cast ANY spells)
- **NO clerical spells** (no Cure Wounds, no Bless, no Hold Person, NOTHING)
- **Magical weapons still work** (swords +1, etc. retain bonuses)
- **Magical armor still works** (plate mail +1, rings, etc. retain bonuses)
- **Potions still work** (can drink healing potions)
- **Wands may not work** (varies)

### What This Means:
- **Pure physical combat only!**
- **No healing during combat** (use potions only)
- **No buffs** (no Bless, Prayer, Enlarge)
- **No crowd control** (no Sleep, Hold Person, Web)
- **No damage spells** (no Magic Missile, Fireball)

### Tactical Implications:
1. **Bring healing potions** (10-15 per character!)
2. **Best weapons and armor mandatory** (+1 or better equipment)
3. **High HP characters prioritized** (fighters, clerics as melee)
4. **Magic-users are useless** (can only attack with daggers!)
5. **Thieves can backstab** (physical ability, not magical)
6. **Positioning is critical** (can't fix mistakes with spells)

**RECOMMENDATION**: This is the HARDEST no-magic area in the game. Prepare extensively!

---

## Three Resolution Paths

### Path A: Peaceful Resolution with "SAVIOR" Password (EASIEST)

**Requirements**: Must have completed [Yarash's Pyramid](YarashPyramid.md) and received "SAVIOR" password from rescued lizardmen

**Process**:
1. Enter Lizardman Keep
2. Meet elderly lizardman chief at Central Keep
3. Chief mentions young upstarts and experiments
4. You mention "SAVIOR" password
5. Chief is satisfied, pledges NOT to join Tyranthraxus
6. **No combat required!**
7. Can still loot pools and buildings peacefully

**Rewards**:
- Quest completion (no lizardman alliance)
- Can loot all treasure peacefully
- No HP/potion expenditure
- ~3,000-4,000 XP from quest completion

**Pros**:
- Zero combat
- Zero risk
- Full treasure access
- Fastest resolution

**Cons**:
- Must complete Yarash's Pyramid first
- Miss combat XP from lizardmen

**RECOMMENDATION**: BEST route if you've done Yarash's Pyramid! Zero risk, full rewards!

---

### Path B: Champion the Chief in Leadership Duel (MEDIUM)

**Requirements**: None (available to everyone)

**Process**:
1. Enter Lizardman Keep
2. Meet elderly lizardman chief
3. Young challenger Drythh appears
4. Drythh challenges chief with "Your claws are blunt"
5. Chief asks you to champion him in duel
6. **Accept** to champion
7. **One party member** fights Drythh 1v1
8. Defeat Drythh
9. Chief thanks you, pledges NOT to join Tyranthraxus
10. Can loot pools and buildings peacefully

**Duel Opponent: Drythh**

**Enemy Stats**:
```
DRYTHH (YOUNG LIZARDMAN CHALLENGER)
- HD: 3d8 HP (~18 HP)
- AC: 5 (Natural scales)
- THAC0: 16
- Damage: 1d4 / 1d4 (claw/claw) or 1d6 (weapon)
- Special: One-on-one duel
- XP: 65
```

**Duel Strategy**:

1. **Choose Your Champion**:
   - Best fighter (highest THAC0, best AC)
   - High HP (20+ recommended)
   - +1 weapon or better
   - Good armor (AC 4 or better)

2. **Pre-Duel Preparation**:
   - **Drink healing potions to full HP** (can't cast spells!)
   - Equip best weapon and armor
   - Have backup healing potions ready

3. **Duel Tactics**:
   - Straightforward melee (no magic available)
   - Drythh has only 18 HP (2-4 hits to kill)
   - AC 5 (moderately easy to hit)
   - Watch for dual claw attacks (2d4 total damage)

4. **If Losing**:
   - Drink healing potions mid-combat
   - Drythh deals ~4-5 damage per round average
   - Keep HP above 10

**Expected Difficulty**: Easy (Drythh is only 18 HP, AC 5)

**Expected Duration**: 3-5 rounds

**Rewards**:
- Quest completion (no lizardman alliance)
- Can loot all treasure peacefully
- Combat XP from Drythh (65 XP)
- ~3,000-4,000 XP from quest completion

**Pros**:
- Relatively easy 1v1 fight
- Don't need Yarash's Pyramid completion
- Full treasure access after
- Chief becomes ally

**Cons**:
- One party member must be strong enough to solo Drythh
- Uses healing potions
- Miss combat XP from other lizardmen

**RECOMMENDATION**: Good option if you haven't done Yarash's Pyramid yet!

---

### Path C: Combat Resolution (HARDEST)

**Requirements**: None (always available)

**Process**:
1. Enter Lizardman Keep
2. Meet elderly lizardman chief
3. When Drythh challenges chief, **decline** to champion
4. **All lizardmen attack**
5. Fight through entire keep
6. Clear all encounters
7. Quest completes when all lizardmen dead

**Enemy Composition**:

```
LIZARDMEN (x30-40 total throughout keep)
- HD: 2+1d8 HP (~10 HP each)
- AC: 5 (Natural scales)
- THAC0: 16
- Damage: 1d3 / 1d3 (claw/claw) or 1d6+1 (weapon)
- XP: 35 each
```

**Why This Is VERY HARD**:
- 30-40 enemies total
- **NO MAGIC** (anti-magic shell!)
- **NO HEALING SPELLS** (potions only!)
- Multiple waves of 6-8 lizardmen
- Can't rest to recover HP (more lizardmen attack)
- Each lizardman has 10 HP (takes 2-3 hits to kill)

**Combat Strategy (EMERGENCY)**:

If you're committed to this path:

1. **Pre-Combat Preparation** (MANDATORY):
   - **15-20 healing potions PER CHARACTER** (no magical healing!)
   - **Best weapons** (+1 or better on EVERYONE)
   - **Best armor** (AC 3 or better)
   - **Full HP** before entering

2. **Encounter Tactics**:
   - **Focus fire** one lizardman at a time (10 HP each)
   - **Ranged attacks** from back row (AC 5 easy to hit)
   - **Melee from fighters** (front line)
   - **Drink healing potions liberally** (no spell healing available!)

3. **Resource Management**:
   - After each encounter, assess HP
   - **Drink potions to stay above 50% HP**
   - Can't rest safely (more encounters)
   - Must clear entire keep without resting

4. **Expected Casualties**:
   - 150-300 HP damage total to party (30-40 lizardmen Ã— 2d3 damage average)
   - Will use 20-30 healing potions total
   - Risk of character death if unlucky

**Expected Difficulty**: Very Hard (no magic, limited healing)

**Expected Duration**: 10-15 encounters, 45+ minutes

**Rewards**:
- Quest completion
- Full treasure from all locations
- **Combat XP from all lizardmen** (~1,050-1,400 XP from 30-40 lizardmen)
- ~3,000-4,000 XP from quest completion
- **Total: ~4,000-5,500 XP**

**Pros**:
- Maximum XP gain
- Can be done without Yarash's Pyramid
- Full combat experience

**Cons**:
- Extremely difficult without magic
- High potion consumption (expensive!)
- Risk of character deaths
- Very time-consuming
- NOT worth the extra XP compared to peaceful routes

**RECOMMENDATION**: **AVOID THIS PATH!** Do Yarash's Pyramid first and use "SAVIOR" password, or champion the chief!

## Key Locations and Encounters

### Location: Central Keep (7-7) - Leadership Challenge

**Description**: A 4x4 area in the center of the keep where the elderly lizardman chief resides.

**NPC**: Elderly Lizardman Chief

**Encounter**: Peaceful initially

**Dialogue**:
- Chief explains young upstarts training by raiding caravans
- Mentions lizardmen experimented on in pyramid
- **If you say "SAVIOR"**: Chief satisfied, peaceful resolution
- **If you don't have password**: Drythh challenges chief

**Drythh's Challenge**:
- Young lizardman named Drythh steps forward
- Says "Your claws are blunt" (leadership challenge)
- Chief asks you to champion him in duel
- **Accept**: 1v1 duel with Drythh
- **Decline**: All lizardmen attack (combat route)

**Tactical Notes**:
- This is the critical decision point
- "SAVIOR" password = instant peaceful resolution (best)
- Champion duel = medium difficulty, peaceful after
- Decline = very hard combat route

---

### Location: Western L-Shaped Building (2-6 and 12-6)

**Description**: Two connected L-shaped ruined buildings on the western side of the keep.

**Encounter**: None (or lizardman guards if combat route)

**Treasure** (use "look" command!):
- **Gold** (500-1,000 GP)
- **Jewelry** (200-500 GP value)

**How to Find**:
- Enter building
- Use **"look" command** (reveals hidden treasure)
- Loot appears

**Tactical Notes**:
- Safe to loot if peaceful resolution
- Must clear lizardmen first if combat route
- Easy to miss treasure without "look" command

**RECOMMENDATION**: Always use "look" command in every room!

---

### Location: Water Pools (Multiple Locations)

**Description**: Several water pools throughout the keep where lizardmen emerge from underwater passages connecting to underground level.

**Locations**: (4-3), (9-3), (3-9), (10-9)

**Encounter**: Lizardmen emerge from pools

**Enemy Composition**: 4-6 Lizardmen per pool

**Enemy Stats**: Standard lizardmen (10 HP, AC 5, 2+1 HD)

**Treasure** (search pools after defeating guards):
- Money (100-300 GP per pool)
- Jewels (50-150 GP value)
- **Shield +2** (occasionally!)

**How It Works**:
1. Approach pool
2. Lizardmen emerge (if not peaceful resolution)
3. Combat (or skip if "SAVIOR" password used)
4. **Search pool** after combat
5. Find treasure

**Shield +2 Drops**:
- Not every pool drops Shield +2
- RNG-based
- Usually 1-2 Shields +2 total from all pools

**Tactical Notes**:
- Manageable numbers (4-6 lizardmen)
- AC 5 easy to hit with ranged
- Use healing potions as needed (no spells!)
- Shields +2 are excellent treasure (AC -2 bonus!)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Search ALL pools for Shields +2!

---

### Underground Level (Accessed via Stairs or Hidden Tunnels)

**Description**: Catacombs beneath the keep, connected to surface pools via underwater passages.

**Access Points**:
- **Exit B**: Stairs (visible)
- **Exit C**: Hidden tunnels (requires "search" command on surface)

**Encounters**: Additional lizardmen (similar to surface)

**Treasure**: Similar to pools (money, jewels)

**Tactical Notes**:
- Optional area (not required for quest completion)
- More lizardmen encounters
- Treasure similar to surface pools
- Connected to pools via water passages

**RECOMMENDATION**:
- **Peaceful route**: Explore for extra treasure
- **Combat route**: Skip unless you need XP/treasure (conserve potions)

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Anti-Magic Combat Tactics

**Without Magic, Focus On**:
1. **Positioning**: Front-line fighters tank, ranged in back
2. **Focus Fire**: Kill one lizardman at a time (10 HP each)
3. **Healing Potions**: Drink liberally, no spell healing available
4. **Equipment**: +1 weapons mandatory, AC 3 or better recommended

### Optimal Party Positioning
```
Front Row: Fighter, Fighter, Cleric (as melee)
Back Row: Thief (bow), Magic-User (sling), Ranger (bow)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Fighters have best AC/HP for tanking
- Cleric forced into melee (no spells anyway)
- Magic-users use slings/darts (better than dagger melee)
- Thieves can backstab (physical ability)

### Healing Potion Management

**Types of Potions**:
- **Potion of Healing**: 2d4+2 HP (~7 HP average)
- **Potion of Extra Healing**: 3d8+3 HP (~16.5 HP average)

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Drink when below 50% HP
- Don't wait until critical (<10 HP)
- Use Extra Healing potions for emergencies
- Budget 10-15 potions per character for full combat run

**Cost**:
- Potion of Healing: ~50-100 GP each
- Potion of Extra Healing: ~200-300 GP each
- **Total for combat route**: 2,000-3,000 GP in potions!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Entering Without "SAVIOR" Password
**Problem**: Forced into difficult duel or very hard combat
**Solution**: Complete Yarash's Pyramid first, get password

### 2. Not Bringing Enough Healing Potions
**Problem**: Run out of healing in anti-magic zone, party wipes
**Solution**: Bring 10-15 potions per character (expensive but necessary)

### 3. Declining to Champion the Chief
**Problem**: Triggers full combat route (30-40 lizardmen without magic!)
**Solution**: Always champion the chief if you don't have password

### 4. Trying to Cast Spells
**Problem**: Anti-magic shell prevents ALL spellcasting
**Solution**: Accept you can't cast, rely on weapons/potions only

### 5. Not Using "Look" Command in Buildings
**Problem**: Miss gold and jewelry treasure
**Solution**: Use "look" command in every room

### 6. Not Searching Pools
**Problem**: Miss Shields +2 and treasure
**Solution**: Search all pools after defeating guards

### 7. Choosing Combat Route for "More XP"
**Problem**: Extra ~1,000 XP not worth 2,000-3,000 GP in potions + risk
**Solution**: Use peaceful routes (password or duel)

---

## Recommended Party Level and Composition

### For Peaceful Resolution (Password or Duel)

---

### For Combat Resolution (NOT RECOMMENDED)

---

## After Completing Lizardman Keep

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Exit keep, return to New Phlan
2. Report to Council Clerk (quest reward + ~3,000-4,000 XP)
3. **Equip Shields +2** on fighters (AC -2 bonus each!)
4. Sell jewelry and gems
5. Resupply healing potions (if used)
6. Train to level up

**Recommended Next Locations**:
- **Level 5-6**: [Buccaneer Base](BuccaneerBase.md) - Rescue mission
- **Level 6-7**: [Temple of Bane](TempleOfBane.md) - If not done yet
- **Level 7-8**: [Zhentil Keep Outpost](ZhentilKeepOutpost.md) - Diplomatic mission

---

## Notes and Tips

1. **Anti-Magic Shell**: The ONLY location with complete magic suppression; prepare accordingly
2. **"SAVIOR" Password**: Best resolution; complete Yarash's Pyramid first!
3. **Champion Duel**: Good alternative if no password; Drythh only has 18 HP
4. **Combat Route**: NOT worth it! Extra XP doesn't justify potion cost + risk
5. **Healing Potions**: Mandatory for anti-magic zone; budget 500-1,500 GP
6. **Shields +2**: Excellent treasure; give to main tanks for AC 0-1
7. **"Look" Command**: Always use in buildings to reveal hidden treasure
8. **Pool Searches**: Must search pools for Shields +2 and treasure
9. **Magic-Users Useless**: Can only use slings/darts; bring them anyway for other quests
10. **Quest Order**: Yarash's Pyramid â†’ Lizardman Keep = easy peaceful resolution
