## Location Description

The Temple of Bane is a dark fortress dedicated to the god of tyranny and strife. Overrun by orc followers displaying Bane's unholy symbol (a black hand on a red field), the temple radiates an aura of evil that must be destroyed.

Your mission is to infiltrate the temple, defeat the orc cleric Mace and his followers, and destroy the evil altar at the heart of the complex. The temple features the highest concentration of random encounters in the gameâ€”prepare for nearly constant combat with massive orc hordes.

## Entry and the Blind Orc Gatekeeper

### Location 1: Temple Entrance (7-7)

**Description**: The main entrance to the Temple of Bane, guarded by an old blind orc and eight orc warriors.

**Encounter**: Blind Orc + 8 Orc Guards

**Enemy Stats**:
```
BLIND ORC GATEKEEPER
- HD: 2d8 HP (~9 HP)
- AC: 6
- THAC0: 19
- Damage: 1d8 (Long Sword)
- Special: Blind (relies on touch to verify identity)

ORC GUARDS (x8)
- HD: 1d8 HP (~4 HP each)
- AC: 6
- THAC0: 19
- Damage: 1d8 (Long Sword)
- Special: Display Bane's holy symbol
```

**Entry Mechanics** (IMPORTANT):

The blind orc will "feel" party members to determine if they bear a holy symbol of Bane.

#### Option A: Have Leather Holy Symbol of Bane (RECOMMENDED)
- Show symbol to blind orc
- Blind orc feels the symbol
- **Guards let you enter peacefully!**
- No combat at entrance

**Where to Get Symbols**:
- [Podol Plaza](PodolPlaza.md) - Evil Shrine (6 symbols)
- [Wealthy District](WealthyDistrict.md) - Random orc patrols (6 symbols)

#### Option B: No Holy Symbol
- Blind orc feels party members
- Determines you're not followers of Bane
- **Guards attack immediately**
- Must fight 8 orcs

**Tactical Note**: Entry requirement seems inconsistent across playthroughs, but having symbols significantly increases peaceful entry chance.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Always bring leather holy symbols from earlier areas!

## The Altar and Mace Boss Fight

### Location: Altar of Bane (7-11) - MAIN OBJECTIVE

**Description**: The dark altar radiates evil energy. Destroying it will cleanse the temple, but Mace and his followers will attack to stop you.

**Boss**: Mace (Orc Cleric)

**Enemy Composition**:
```
MACE (ORC CLERIC BOSS)
- HD: 5d8 HP (~22 HP)
- AC: 2 (Scale Mail +1, Shield +1)
- THAC0: 16
- Damage: 1d6+2 (Mace +1)
- **Spells**: Hold Person (x2), Cure Light Wounds (x2), Bless, Prayer, Spiritual Hammer
- Special: Can heal himself mid-combat
- Special: Hold Person can disable multiple party members
- XP: 420

ORC FIGHTERS (x15-20)
- HD: 1d8 HP (~4 HP each)
- AC: 6
- THAC0: 19
- Damage: 1d8 (Long Sword)

ORC BOWMEN (x10-15)
- HD: 1d8 HP (~4 HP each)
- AC: 6
- THAC0: 19
- Damage: 1d6 (Short Bow)
- Range: 60 feet
```

**Total Enemies**: ~30-40 orcs + Mace (VERY LARGE BATTLE)

**Why This Fight Is Difficult**:
- 30-40 enemies acting (mass action economy against you)
- Mace can cast Hold Person (disables 1-4 party members per cast!)
- Mace can heal himself (prolongs boss fight)
- Bowmen attack from range (can't reach immediately)
- Massive damage potential from sheer numbers

**Tactical Strategy**:

### Pre-Combat Preparation (CRITICAL):
```
MANDATORY BUFFS:
1. Bless (all party) - +1 hit/damage
2. Prayer (all party) - +1 hit/damage/saves
3. Protection from Evil (all party if possible) - +2 AC vs. evil, +2 saves
4. Resist Fire (if available)
5. Haste (if available) - doubles attacks
6. Full HP on all characters
```

### Opening Round - KILL MACE IMMEDIATELY:
1. **All Magic Missile spells at Mace** (2-3 Magic-Users = 6d4+6 damage = ~21 damage)
   - This likely kills Mace instantly (he only has 22 HP!)
   - **CRITICAL**: If Mace survives round 1, he will Hold Person multiple party members!

2. **All ranged attacks at Mace** (if he survives Magic Missiles)
   - Archers focus Mace
   - Mace has AC 2 (moderately hard to hit but must try)

3. **Ignore orcs until Mace is dead!**
   - Orc fighters/bowmen are minimal threat compared to Hold Person
   - Each orc only has 4 HP

### After Mace Dies:
1. **Sleep spell x2-3** (each affects 4 HD = ~4 orcs)
   - Eliminates 8-12 orcs immediately
   - Massive action economy swing

2. **Hold Person** (clerics)
   - Target remaining orc fighters

3. **Fireball** (if available)
   - Perfect for grouped orc hordes
   - 10d6 damage hits multiple orcs (4 HP each = instant kills)

4. **Missile fire at bowmen**
   - Archers target orc bowmen
   - Keep them from peppering your party

5. **Melee cleanup**
   - Fighters kill held/sleeping orcs
   - Standard combat

### Expected Battle Length:
- Round 1: Kill Mace
- Round 2-3: Sleep/Fireball mass orcs
- Round 4-6: Cleanup remaining orcs
- Total: 5-7 rounds

**Loot from Mace** (EXCELLENT):
- **Mace +1** (1d6+1 damage, best cleric weapon at this stage)
- **Journal Entry 25** (story information)
- Scale Mail +1
- Shield +1
- Clerical scrolls

**Altar Destruction**:
- After defeating Mace and all orcs, destroy the altar
- "Uneasy feeling" disappears
- Quest complete!

## Trap Doors - Hidden Treasure Caches

The Temple of Bane contains **four trap doors** with valuable loot hidden beneath the temple.

### Trap Door 1: Location (4-5)

**Contents**:
- **Clerical Scrolls**: Cure Light Wounds, Cure Serious Wounds, Protection from Evil
- **Magic-User Scrolls**: Magic Missile, Shield, Detect Magic

**Value**: Moderate (scrolls worth ~500-800 GP)

**Trap**: Likely trapped (use search mode)

---

### Trap Door 2: Location (6-8)

**Contents** (EXCELLENT):
- **Potion of Giant Strength** (sets STR to 18/00 temporarily, +6 damage!)
- **Potion of Healing** x2
- **Potion of Speed** (equivalent to Haste spell)
- **Wand of Magic Missiles** (charged wand, auto-hit attacks)
- **Dust of Disappearance** (party invisibility, surprise round)

**Value**: High (~3,000-4,000 GP worth)

**Tactical Importance**: Potion of Giant Strength and Dust of Disappearance are extremely valuable for boss fights!

**RECOMMENDATION**: Save these for harder encounters (Valhingen Graveyard, Valjevo Castle)

---

### Trap Door 3: Location (8-8)

**Contents**: Similar to trap door 2 (varies by playthrough)

**Potential Items**:
- Healing potions
- Magic scrolls
- Miscellaneous magical items

**Value**: Moderate

---

### Trap Door 4: Location (12-9)

**Contents** (WEAPONS CACHE):
- **8 Magical Weapons** (all +1 enchantment):
  - Axe +1
  - Axe +1 (second one)
  - Dagger +1
  - Dagger +1 (second one)
  - Hammer +1
  - Hammer +1 (second one)
  - Mace +1
  - Mace +1 (second one)

**Value**: High (~4,000-5,000 GP total)

**Tactical Use**:
- Equip on characters lacking magical weapons
- Sell extras for gold (500-600 GP each)
- Keep 1-2 for backup weapons

**Note**: These are duplicate +1 weapons (pairs of each type)

---

## Random Encounters (EXTREME FREQUENCY)

**WARNING**: Temple of Bane has the **HIGHEST random encounter rate in the game!**

**Encounter Frequency**: Every 1-2 minutes of exploration (compared to 3-5 minutes elsewhere)

**Common Enemy Types**:
- **Orcs** (most common, 1 HD, AC 6, 4 HP)
- **Hobgoblins** (1+1 HD, AC 5, 6 HP)
- **Ogres** (4+1 HD, AC 5, 19 HP, dangerous)
- **Orc patrols** (4 orcs with holy symbols)

**Typical Encounter Sizes**: 12-20 enemies per encounter

**Special Encounter**: 4-Orc Patrols

**4-Orc Patrol**:
- 4 orcs bearing shields with black hand on red field (Bane's symbol)
- **These patrols are special**: They never check your charisma
- They attempt to lure you into the temple
- Defeating them yields **6 leather holy symbols of Bane**

**XP Farming**: Each encounter yields ~100-300 XP

**Total Random Encounters**: Expect 15-25+ encounters before clearing temple

**Resource Management Challenge**:
- High encounter frequency drains spells quickly
- Must conserve spell slots for Mace boss fight
- Use Sleep efficiently (each Sleep handles ~4 orcs)
- Use Hold Person on harder enemies (hobgoblins, ogres if available)

**Tactical Recommendations**:
1. **Conserve high-level spells** (Fireball, Lightning Bolt) for Mace fight
2. **Use Sleep liberally** on orcs (1 HD, always works)
3. **Avoid resting in temple** (triggers more encounters)
4. **Retreat to New Phlan** if low on resources
5. **Bring extra healing potions** (5-6 per character minimum)

### Pre-Temple Preparation

```
MEMORIZE:
- Magic-Users: Sleep x4-5, Magic Missile x3-4, Fireball x1-2

**Boss Fight** (Mace + 30-40 Orcs):
- ALL Magic Missile on Mace (kill round 1)
- Fireball on grouped orcs (after Mace dies)
- Sleep x2-3 on remaining orcs
- Standard cleanup

### Positioning
- **Fighters in front** (AC 2-3, high HP)
- **Clerics mid-row** (casting range, healing)
- **Magic-Users in back** (protect from melee)
- **Archers on flanks** (line of sight to enemies)

### When to Retreat
- **Below 50% spell slots**
- **Below 30% party HP**
- **No Sleep spells remaining**
- **Multiple characters at <10 HP**

**Retreat Route**: Exit temple, return to New Phlan, rest, resupply, return

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Bringing Holy Symbols
**Problem**: Must fight blind orc + 8 guards at entrance
**Solution**: Get 6 symbols from Podol Plaza or Wealthy District first

### 2. Using Fireball on Random Encounters
**Problem**: No Fireball for Mace boss fight (30-40 enemies!)
**Solution**: Save Fireball exclusively for Mace encounter

### 3. Not Killing Mace First
**Problem**: Mace casts Hold Person x2, disables multiple party members, heals himself
**Solution**: All Magic Missile + ranged on Mace round 1 (22 HP only)

### 4. Not Bringing Enough Healing Potions
**Problem**: Temple has highest encounter rate in game, run out of healing
**Solution**: Bring 20-30 potions, retreat to New Phlan if needed

### 5. Resting Inside Temple
**Problem**: Random encounters continue while resting, doesn't recover resources
**Solution**: Exit temple, rest in New Phlan, return

### 6. Missing Trap Doors
**Problem**: Miss Wand of Magic Missiles, Potion of Giant Strength, Dust of Disappearance
**Solution**: Use search mode, systematically check coordinates

### 7. Not Conserving Sleep Spells
**Problem**: Run out of Sleep before Mace fight
**Solution**: Memorize 4-5 Sleep spells, use one per encounter maximum

### 8. Fighting Orcs Instead of Sleeping Them
**Problem**: Waste HP and time on trivial enemies
**Solution**: Sleep is nearly 100% effective on 1 HD orcs (instant win)

## Notes and Tips

1. **Leather Holy Symbols**: Get from Podol Plaza (Evil Shrine) or Wealthy District (orc patrols) BEFORE entering temple
2. **Sleep Spell Efficiency**: Each Sleep spell handles ~4 orcs (1 HD each); most efficient spell in temple
3. **Mace Boss Priority**: MUST kill Mace round 1 or he disables party with Hold Person
4. **Random Encounter Frequency**: Highest in game; expect combat every 1-2 minutes
5. **Dust of Disappearance**: Critical for Valjevo Castle final boss (grants surprise round)
6. **Wand of Magic Missiles**: Excellent for characters without spell slots (fighters can use!)
7. **Retreat and Return**: Temple allows leaving and returning; rest in New Phlan if low on resources
8. **Fireball Conservation**: Save ALL Fireball spells for Mace boss fight (30-40 enemies grouped!)
9. **Healing Potion Economy**: 20-30 potions sounds excessive but you'll use most of them
10. **4-Orc Patrols**: Don't attack unless you need more holy symbols; they're trying to lure you in

---

## Connection to Wealthy District

**IMPORTANT**: Temple of Bane is connected to the [Wealthy District](WealthyDistrict.md) quest!

- Wealthy District encounters don't end until Temple of Bane is cleared
- Both areas have 4-orc patrols with holy symbols
- Clearing Temple of Bane makes Wealthy District a safe resting location

**Recommended Order**:
1. Clear [Wealthy District](WealthyDistrict.md) partially (get holy symbols)
2. Clear Temple of Bane (using symbols for entry)
3. Return to Wealthy District (now safe for resting)
