# Nomad Camp

## Overview

**Recommended Level**: 3-5
**Difficulty**: Easy-Medium (depending on approach)
**Primary Objective**: Prevent nomads from joining Tyranthraxus's forces
**Secondary Objectives**: Defend camp from kobold attacks OR defeat nomad leader
**Completion Requirement**: Choose diplomatic or combat resolution

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Diplomatic approach yields better rewards (8,000 GP + Two-Handed Sword +2 + Wand of Magic Missiles)!

---

## Location Description

The Nomad Camp is a temporary settlement in the wilderness, home to a tribe of desert nomads led by Hassad Ahwal. The Council of New Phlan fears these nomads may be recruited by Tyranthraxus's forces and has sent you to either secure their alliance or eliminate them.

The camp is under threat from kobold raids originating from the nearby Kobold Cave. Your approach—diplomatic or aggressive—will determine the outcome of this quest and the rewards you receive.

## Critical Decision: Two Approaches

Upon entering the Nomad Camp, you'll be challenged by nomad warriors. Your response determines the entire quest outcome.

### Approach A: Diplomatic Route (RECOMMENDED)

**Initial Choice**: Choose to **parlay** when challenged

**Process**:
1. Parlay with nomad guards
2. Accept feast invitation from Hassad Ahwal
3. Agree to help defend camp from kobold attacks
4. Rest in your tent (#2)
5. Defend against 3 waves of kobold attacks (~24 hours later)
6. Receive rewards from Hassad

**Rewards** (EXCELLENT):
- **~8,000 Gold Pieces**
- **Two-Handed Sword +2** (1d10+2 damage, best two-handed weapon!)
- **Wand of Magic Missiles** (charged wand, auto-hit attacks)
- **~6,000 XP** (upon reporting to Council)
- **Gems and jewelry**

**Combat Difficulty**: Easy
- 3 kobold waves (kobolds are weak, 1d4 HP each)
- Nomad allies help you fight
- Straightforward battles

**Pros**:
- Better overall rewards (8,000 GP vs 5,000 GP)
- Two-Handed Sword +2 (superior weapon)
- Easier combat (nomads help, kobolds are weak)
- More total XP from kobold battles
- Feel-good outcome (help innocents)

**Cons**:
- Takes longer (~24 in-game hours for attacks)
- Must defend 3 separate battles

---

### Approach B: Combat Route

**Initial Choice**: **Attack** nomads when challenged

**Process**:
1. Attack nomad guards when challenged
2. Fight through camp to headman's tent
3. Defeat Hassad Ahwal (leader)
4. Loot camp
5. Return to Council

**Rewards**:
- **5,000 Gold Pieces**
- **Bracers AC 2** (AC -2 bonus, equivalent to Ring of Protection +2)
- **Wand of Magic Missiles** (same as diplomatic route)
- **Scale Mail +2** (AC 4, decent armor)
- **~6,000 XP** (upon reporting to Council)

**Combat Difficulty**: Medium-Hard
- Fight multiple nomad warriors (Level 4 fighters, ~30 HP each, AC 4)
- Fight Hassad Ahwal (Level 6 fighter, ~45 HP, AC -6!)
- Nomad shaman (Level 4 magic-user, ~20 HP)

**Pros**:
- Faster completion (no 24-hour wait)
- Bracers AC 2 (very good defensive item)
- Immediate resolution

**Cons**:
- Harder combat (nomads are tough!)
- Less gold (5,000 vs 8,000)
- No Two-Handed Sword +2 (inferior weapon rewards)
- Morally questionable (killing innocents)

---

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Diplomatic Route | Combat Route |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Gold Reward | ~8,000 GP | ~5,000 GP |
| Best Weapon | Two-Handed Sword +2 | Scale Mail +2 |
| Best Armor | - | Bracers AC 2 |
| Both Get | Wand of Magic Missiles | Wand of Magic Missiles |
| Combat Difficulty | Easy (kobolds) | Hard (nomads) |
| Time Required | ~24 in-game hours | Immediate |
| Total XP | Higher (kobolds + quest) | Lower (quest only) |
| Moral Outcome | Help innocents | Kill innocents |

**RECOMMENDATION**: **Diplomatic Route** yields better rewards (Two-Handed Sword +2 is superior to Bracers AC 2) and easier combat!

## Combat Route Walkthrough (Alternative)

### Step 1: Attack Nomads

**Location**: Camp Entrance (1)

**Action**: Attack when challenged

**Initial Battle**: 8-10 Nomad Warriors

**Enemy Stats**:
```
NOMAD WARRIORS (x8-10)
- HD: 4d10 HP (~22 HP each)
- AC: 4 (Chain Mail, Shield)
- THAC0: 17
- Damage: 1d8+1 (Long Sword +1) or 1d6 (Short Bow)
- XP: 175 each
```

**Tactical Strategy**:
1. **Hold Person** (clerics) - affects humanoids
2. **Sleep does NOT work** (4 HD, immune)
3. **Magic Missile** for guaranteed hits
4. **Focus fire** one nomad at a time (22 HP each)

**Expected Difficulty**: Medium (nomads are level 4 fighters with good AC)

---

### Step 2: Fight Through Camp

**Encounters**: Multiple groups of nomad warriors

**Total Nomads**: ~20-30 throughout camp

**Tactical Notes**:
- Conserve spell slots for Hassad fight
- Use Hold Person efficiently
- Heal between encounters

---

### Step 3: Fight Nomad Shaman (Optional)

**Location**: Near headman's tent

**Boss**: Nomad Shaman (Level 4 Magic-User)

**Enemy Stats**:
```
NOMAD SHAMAN
- HD: 4d4 HP (~10 HP)
- AC: 10 (Robes)
- THAC0: 19
- Damage: 1d4 (Dagger)
- Spells: Magic Missile, Web, Fireball (if high level), Shield
- Special: If you help nomads, you get his wand as reward
- XP: 270
```

**Tactical Strategy**:
1. **Kill shaman immediately** (low HP, dangerous spells)
2. **Magic Missile him** (10 HP = 2-3 Magic Missiles kills)
3. **Ranged focus fire** (AC 10, easy to hit)

**Expected Difficulty**: Medium (depends on his spell selection)

**Loot**: Wand of Magic Missiles (if killed)

---

### Step 4: Defeat Hassad Ahwal (Final Boss)

**Location**: Headman's Tent (3)

**Boss**: Hassad Ahwal (Nomad Leader)

**Enemy Stats**:
```
HASSAD AHWAL (BOSS)
- HD: 6d10 HP (~33 HP, but sources say ~45 HP)
- AC: -6 (VERY LOW - Plate Mail +3, Ring of Protection +2, DEX bonus)
- THAC0: 15
- Damage: 1d8+3 (Long Sword +2, STR bonus)
- Special: Excellent AC makes him hard to hit
- XP: 650
```

**Why This Fight Is Hard**:
- **AC -6** is extremely difficult to hit (need 21+ on d20 for most characters!)
- 45 HP (takes many hits to kill)
- Surrounded by nomad guards
- Good damage output (1d8+3)

**Tactical Strategy**:

1. **Pre-Combat Buffs** (MANDATORY):
   - Bless (all party, +1 to hit)
   - Prayer (if available, +1 to hit)
   - Enlarge (fighters, +1 to hit, +6 damage)
   - Any other hit bonuses!

2. **Opening Round**:
   - **Magic Missile x3-4** on Hassad (auto-hit, bypass AC -6!)
   - **Hold Person** on guards
   - **All fighters attack Hassad**

3. **Melee Phase**:
   - **ONLY use Magic Missile on Hassad** (auto-hit is critical at AC -6)
   - Fighters attack with best weapons (+1 or better)
   - Expect to miss 70%+ of melee attacks (AC -6!)
   - Keep HP above 15 (Hassad hits hard)

4. **Expected Battle Length**: 5-8 rounds (45 HP + AC -6 = slow kill)

**Loot** (from Hassad and camp):
- 5,000 Gold Pieces
- Bracers AC 2
- Wand of Magic Missiles (from shaman)
- Scale Mail +2
- Gems and jewelry

---

### Step 5: Return to New Phlan

**Action**: Leave camp, return to New Phlan

**Report**: Talk to Council Clerk

**Quest Reward**: ~6,000 XP + quest completion bonus

---

## Quest Timing and Kobold Cave Connection

**IMPORTANT**: This quest is connected to the [Kobold Cave](KoboldCave.md) quest!

### Quest Order Matters:

#### Scenario A: Clear Kobold Cave FIRST, then visit Nomad Camp
- **Result**: No kobold attacks occur at Nomad Camp
- **Diplomatic route**: Accept feast, no battles, receive rewards immediately
- **Combat route**: Still works normally
- **Rewards**: Still get full rewards from diplomatic or combat route
- **Council**: Receive reward from Phlan Council only (not from Hassad for defense)

#### Scenario B: Visit Nomad Camp FIRST, then clear Kobold Cave
- **Result**: Kobold attacks happen as normal (3 waves)
- **Diplomatic route**: Defend against 3 kobold waves, receive full rewards
- **Combat route**: Kill nomads, no connection to Kobold Cave
- **Rewards**: Full rewards from both Hassad and Council

**RECOMMENDATION**: Visit Nomad Camp FIRST (before Kobold Cave) to experience full diplomatic quest and get Two-Handed Sword +2!

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Diplomatic Route Strategy

**Kobold Wave Combat**:
```
MEMORIZE:
- Magic-Users: Sleep x2-3 (very effective vs kobolds!)
- Clerics: Cure Light Wounds x2, Bless
- Minimal spell usage required

TACTICS:
1. Sleep spell (handles 4 kobolds per cast)
2. Let nomad allies tank
3. Missile fire from safety
4. Easy cleanup
```

**Resource Management**:
- 3 waves of kobolds (very easy)
- Use 1 Sleep per wave maximum
- Save healing for after quest

---

### Combat Route Strategy

**Nomad Combat**:
```
MEMORIZE:
- Magic-Users: Magic Missile x4 (for Hassad AC -6!), Haste
- Clerics: Cure Serious Wounds x2, Hold Person x2, Bless, Prayer
- Prepare for difficult AC -6 boss fight

TACTICS - Nomad Warriors:
1. Hold Person (works on humanoids)
2. Focus fire one at a time (22 HP each)
3. Magic Missile for guaranteed hits

TACTICS - Hassad Ahwal (AC -6 BOSS):
1. Bless + Prayer + Enlarge (MANDATORY for hit bonuses!)
2. Magic Missile x4 on Hassad (auto-hit, ~20-30 damage total)
3. All fighters attack Hassad (expect 70% miss rate!)
4. Keep HP above 15
5. 5-8 round fight
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Choosing Combat Route for "Better Loot"
**Problem**: Diplomatic route actually gives better rewards (8,000 GP + Two-Handed Sword +2)
**Solution**: Choose diplomatic unless you specifically want Bracers AC 2

### 2. Clearing Kobold Cave Before Nomad Camp
**Problem**: Miss kobold defense battles, lose some XP
**Solution**: Visit Nomad Camp FIRST, then clear Kobold Cave

### 3. Not Buffing Before Hassad Fight (Combat Route)
**Problem**: AC -6 means you miss 70%+ attacks without buffs
**Solution**: Cast Bless + Prayer + Enlarge for +3 total to-hit bonus

### 4. Using Sleep on Nomad Warriors (Combat Route)
**Problem**: Nomads have 4 HD, immune to Sleep
**Solution**: Use Hold Person instead (works on humanoids)

### 5. Wasting Magic Missile on Kobolds (Diplomatic Route)
**Problem**: Sleep spell is more efficient (handles 4 kobolds per cast)
**Solution**: Let nomads tank, use Sleep, save Magic Missile for harder quests

### 6. Not Letting Nomad Allies Tank (Diplomatic Route)
**Problem**: Take unnecessary damage from weak kobolds
**Solution**: Position behind nomads, let them absorb kobold attacks

---

## Notes and Tips

1. **Diplomatic Route = Better Rewards**: 8,000 GP + Two-Handed Sword +2 > 5,000 GP + Bracers AC 2
2. **Quest Order Matters**: Visit Nomad Camp BEFORE Kobold Cave for full experience
3. **Kobold Waves Are Easy**: Let nomad allies tank, use Sleep, trivial battles
4. **Hassad AC -6**: If fighting him, MUST use Magic Missile (auto-hit) and buffs
5. **Two-Handed Sword +2**: Best two-handed weapon until endgame (1d10+2)
6. **Wand of Magic Missiles**: Excellent item, usable by ANY class (fighters can use!)
7. **Bracers AC 2**: Only reason to choose combat route; great for magic-users
8. **Nomad Allies**: Friendly nomads have good stats (AC 4, 22+ HP), let them tank
9. **24-Hour Wait**: Diplomatic route requires in-game time passage (not real time)
10. **Map to Camp**: Found in Kobold Cave barracks if you need help navigating wilderness
