# Wealthy District

## Overview

**Recommended Level**: 6-7
**Difficulty**: Medium (Connected to Temple of Bane)
**Primary Objective**: Clear area of Bane followers, gather intelligence
**Secondary Objectives**: Collect leather holy symbols, find treasure
**Completion Requirement**: Clear Temple of Bane (encounters continue until then)

**IMPORTANT**: This area is **directly connected** to the [Temple of Bane](TempleOfBane.md) quest!

---

## Location Description

The Wealthy District was once home to New Phlan's most prosperous citizens. Now overrun by followers of Bane (orcs, hobgoblins, and ogres displaying the black hand symbol), the mansions and estates have been looted and occupied by these invaders.

Your mission is to clear the district of Bane's followers and gather any intelligence about their operations. The area serves as a staging ground for the Temple of Bane and won't fully clear until the temple itself is cleansed.

**Key Feature**: After clearing the Temple of Bane, the Wealthy District becomes a **safe resting location**!

## Connection to Temple of Bane

**CRITICAL MECHANIC**: Random encounters in the Wealthy District **continue indefinitely** until you clear the [Temple of Bane](TempleOfBane.md)!

**How It Works**:
1. Enter Wealthy District → constant orc/hobgoblin/ogre encounters
2. Clear fixed locations (dead bodies, goblin slaves, trap door, etc.)
3. Random encounters KEEP COMING
4. Must clear Temple of Bane to stop encounters
5. After Temple of Bane cleared → Wealthy District becomes safe resting area

**Recommended Strategy**:
1. Enter Wealthy District briefly
2. Get holy symbols from 4-orc patrols (if needed)
3. Talk to goblin slaves (get intel)
4. Loot fixed treasure locations
5. **EXIT and clear Temple of Bane**
6. Return to Wealthy District (now safe) for any remaining treasure

---

## Special Encounter: 4-Orc Patrols

**CRITICAL**: These are special scripted encounters that provide holy symbols!

**Description**: Four orcs whose shields bear "a black hand on a red field" (Bane's holy symbol)

- HD: 1d8 HP (~4 HP each)

```

**Special Behavior**:
- These patrols **never check charisma**

**Tactical Strategy**:
1. Sleep spell (affects all 4 orcs - they have 1 HD)
2. Kill sleeping orcs
3. Loot bodies

**Loot**: **6x Leather Holy Symbols of Bane** (CRITICAL for Temple of Bane entry!)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Defeat one patrol to get 6 holy symbols, then proceed to Temple of Bane!

- Bane followers constantly patrol
- Only clearing Temple of Bane stops reinforcements

**Tactical Response**:
1. **Don't try to "clear" random encounters** (they're infinite!)
2. **Get holy symbols from one 4-orc patrol**
3. **Loot fixed locations quickly**
4. **EXIT and clear Temple of Bane**
5. **Return later** (area safe after temple cleared)

## Sleep Spell Efficiency

- Sleep affects 4 HD worth = 4 orcs per spell
- Nearly 100% success rate against orcs

**Recommended Loadout**:
- Memorize Sleep x4-5
- Use one Sleep per encounter
- Save higher-level spells for Temple of Bane

**Example Encounter**:
- 12 orcs attack
- Cast Sleep = 4 orcs sleeping
- Cast Sleep = 4 more orcs sleeping
- 4 orcs remaining (easy melee cleanup)

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Pre-Wealthy District Preparation

```
MEMORIZE:
- Magic-Users: Sleep x4-5, Magic Missile x2 (save rest for Temple)
- Clerics: Cure Light Wounds x3, Hold Person x1, Bless
- Prepare: Healing Potions (3-4 per character)
- Equipment: +1 weapons, AC 4 or better

STRATEGY:
- This is a QUICK run for holy symbols and fixed loot
- Don't waste resources trying to clear infinite encounters
- Save spell slots for Temple of Bane
```

### Encounter Tactics

**Orcs** (90% of encounters):
1. Sleep spell (one spell = 4 sleeping orcs)
2. Missile fire on sleeping targets
3. Melee cleanup

**Hobgoblins** (occasional):
1. Sleep (still effective on 1+1 HD)
2. Hold Person (if Sleep fails)
3. Standard melee

**Ogres** (rare but dangerous):
1. Hold Person (if available)
2. Focus fire (19 HP each)
3. Magic Missile for guaranteed hits

### Resource Management

**Goal**: Spend minimal resources in Wealthy District, save for Temple of Bane

**Efficient Clearing**:
1. Use Sleep liberally (orcs are 1 HD)
2. Avoid unnecessary fights (hay beds!)
3. Don't try to clear infinite encounters
4. Get in, loot, get out

**Spell Conservation**:
- Sleep: OK to use (low level, very effective here)
- Magic Missile: SAVE for Temple of Bane (Mace boss)
- Fireball: SAVE for Temple of Bane (30-40 enemies)
- Hold Person: OK to use sparingly

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Trying to "Clear" All Random Encounters
**Problem**: Encounters are infinite until Temple of Bane cleared
**Solution**: Loot fixed locations, get holy symbols, EXIT immediately

### 2. Searching Hay Beds (Location 10)
**Problem**: Triggers orc ambush, no treasure reward
**Solution**: Skip hay beds entirely, not worth the HP/spell cost

### 3. Not Getting Holy Symbols
**Problem**: Can't enter Temple of Bane peacefully
**Solution**: Defeat one 4-orc patrol, collect 6 symbols

### 4. Wasting High-Level Spells
**Problem**: Use Fireball/Lightning Bolt on trivial orc encounters
**Solution**: Save all high-level spells for Temple of Bane boss fight

### 5. Not Talking to Goblin Slaves
**Problem**: Miss critical intel about holy symbol requirement
**Solution**: Always talk to peaceful NPCs for information

### 6. Missing Trap Door
**Problem**: Miss Potion of Extra Healing and Ring of Feather Falling
**Solution**: Use search mode, check coordinates (7-3)

### 7. Fighting Instead of Sleeping Orcs
**Problem**: Waste HP and time when Sleep instant-wins
**Solution**: Memorize Sleep x4-5, use liberally on orcs

## Notes and Tips

1. **Holy Symbols**: Primary reason to visit this area; critical for Temple of Bane entry
2. **Infinite Encounters**: Don't waste time/resources fighting; loot and leave
3. **Sleep Spell Dominance**: 90% of enemies are orcs (1 HD); Sleep wins instantly
4. **Safe Resting After Temple**: Becomes valuable rest spot after Temple of Bane cleared
5. **Goblin Slave Intel**: Confirms holy symbol requirement; helpful for new players
6. **Hay Beds Trap**: No treasure, just combat; always skip
7. **Quick In-and-Out**: Should spend <30 minutes here; get symbols and leave
8. **4-Orc Patrols**: Never check charisma; trying to lure you to temple
9. **Potion of Extra Healing**: Save for harder fights (3d8+3 = ~18 HP heal!)
10. **Connection to Temple**: Quest doesn't fully complete until both areas cleared
