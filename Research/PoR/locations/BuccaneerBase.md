# Buccaneer Base

## Overview

**Recommended Level**: 7-9 (Captain is VERY difficult!)
**Difficulty**: Very Hard (Captain has AC -3, 110 HP!)
**Primary Objective**: Rescue young heir to House of Bivant
**Secondary Objectives**: Defeat Captain for BEST EQUIPMENT in game
**Completion Requirement**: Rescue heir (multiple methods available)

**CRITICAL**: Captain drops **Plate Mail +3** (best armor!), **Long Sword +4** (best weapon!), and **Shield +2**!

---

## Location Description

The Buccaneer Base is a fortified pirate camp in the western wilderness, serving as the headquarters for a ruthless band of buccaneers. They've kidnapped the young heir to the noble House of Bivant and are holding him for ransom in their slave pens.

Your mission is to rescue the heir. You have multiple options: purchase his freedom, create a distraction with animals, sneak in stealthily, or launch a full assault. The full assault option, while most dangerous, offers access to the Captain's incredible equipmentâ€”the best armor and weapon in the entire game.

**Warning**: The Captain is stronger than most late-game bosses, including Tyranthraxus himself! This is not a fight for unprepared parties.

Legend:
2 = Barracks (3-2) - Five waves of buccaneers/fighters (full assault route)
4 = Slave Pen (5-4) - Heir location (heart-shaped birthmark), guarded

7 = Captain's Quarters (7-7) - CAPTAIN BOSS (Plate Mail +3, Long Sword +4, Shield +2!)
```

## Four Approaches to Rescue the Heir

### Approach A: Purchase Freedom (Expensive, Peaceful)

**Cost**: ~75% of party's total money and jewels

**How It Works**:
1. Seedy man offers "pass" to Captain's quarters for 125 platinum pieces (12,500 GP!)
2. Purchase pass
3. Meet Captain peacefully
4. Captain offers to sell heir for massive sum (~75% of your wealth)
5. Pay ransom
6. Heir released
7. Quest complete

**Pros**:
- No combat
- Zero risk of death
- Fastest method
- Heir guaranteed safe

**Cons**:
- **Extremely expensive** (can cost 30,000-50,000 GP!)
- **Miss Plate Mail +3, Long Sword +4, Shield +2** (best equipment in game!)
- No combat XP
- Financially crippling

**RECOMMENDATION**: **DO NOT USE THIS METHOD!** Equipment from Captain is worth far more than gold cost!

---

### Approach B: Stealth Entry (Unreliable)

**How It Works**:
1. Sneak past guards at slave pen gate
2. Enter slave pen (#4)
3. Rescue heir
4. Attempt to leave

**Reality**: "This has never worked for us" (per multiple guides)

**What Actually Happens**:
- Stealth check usually fails
- Guards detect party
- Forced into combat anyway
- At least one buccaneer fight on exit

**Pros**:
- Would be fast if it worked
- No massive battles

**Cons**:
- **Doesn't reliably work!**
- Usually forced into combat anyway
- Miss Captain's equipment
- Unreliable method

**RECOMMENDATION**: **AVOID!** Too unreliable, usually forces combat without the full rewards.

---

### Approach C: Animal Distraction (Good Middle Ground)

**How It Works**:
1. Go to Animal Pen (#5)
2. Release animals (various beasts)
3. Animals stampede through camp
4. Buccaneers distracted by chaos
5. Sneak to Slave Pen (#4)
6. Only need to fight slave pen guards
7. Rescue heir
8. Fight one buccaneer group on exit
9. Quest complete

**Enemy Encounters**:
- Slave pen guards: 8-10 Level 3-5 Fighters
- Exit guards: 6-8 Buccaneers

**Pros**:
- Minimal combat (2 fights only)
- Much easier than full assault
- Heir rescued safely
- Saves HP and resources

**Cons**:
- **Miss Plate Mail +3, Long Sword +4, Shield +2** (Captain's loot!)
- Less total XP than full assault
- No access to Captain's quarters

**RECOMMENDATION**: Good option if party level 7-8 and not ready for Captain fight!

---

### Approach D: Full Assault (Hardest, Best Rewards)

**How It Works**:
1. Attack Barracks (#2)
2. Triggers **five consecutive waves** of buccaneers and fighters
3. Defeat all waves
4. Fight to Captain's Quarters (#7)
5. **Defeat Captain** (AC -3, 110 HP!)
6. **Loot: Plate Mail +3, Long Sword +4, Shield +2**
7. All slaves (including heir) freed
8. Quest complete

**Total Encounters**:
- 5 waves at barracks (~40-50 enemies total)
- Captain + guards (~10 enemies)
- **Total: ~50-60 enemies!**

**Pros**:
- **PLATE MAIL +3** (best armor in game!)
- **LONG SWORD +4** (best one-handed weapon in game!)
- **SHIELD +2** (stacks with armor)
- Maximum XP (~5,000-7,000 total)
- All slaves freed
- Complete victory

**Cons**:
- **EXTREMELY difficult** (Captain harder than Tyranthraxus!)
- High HP/spell expenditure
- Risk of character deaths
- Multiple resurrection costs possible
- Very time-consuming

**RECOMMENDATION**: **BEST ROUTE for endgame parties (level 8-9+)!** Equipment is essential for Valjevo Castle!

## The Captain Boss Fight

### Location #7: Captain's Quarters - FINAL BOSS

**Description**: The Captain of the Buccaneer Base awaits in his quarters with elite guards.

**Boss**: The Captain (Legendary Fighter)

**Enemy Composition**:
```
THE CAPTAIN (BOSS)
- HD: 10d10+20 HP (~110 HP!!!)
- AC: -3 (Plate Mail +3, Shield +2, DEX bonus, Ring of Protection +2)
- THAC0: 11
- Damage: 1d8+6 (Long Sword +4, +2 STR bonus = 3-14 per hit!)
- Special: "Stronger than Tyranthraxus himself!"
- Special: Can attack twice per round (high level fighter)
- XP: 3,000

ELITE GUARDS (x8-10)
- HD: 6d10 HP (~33 HP each)
- AC: 2 (Plate Mail, Shield)
- THAC0: 15
- Damage: 1d8+2 (Long Sword +1)
- XP: 420 each
```

**Why The Captain Is The Hardest Fight In The Game**:
- **110 HP** (more than Tyranthraxus, more than Valjevo dragon!)
- **AC -3** (extremely hard to hit - need 24+ on d20 for most characters!)
- **Attacks twice per round** (high-level fighter)
- **3-14 damage PER HIT** (can deal 28 damage in one round!)
- **Surrounded by 8-10 elite guards** (33 HP each, AC 2)
- **Can one-shot party members**
- **Resistant to Hold Person** (high saves)

**Tactical Strategy (CRITICAL)**:

This fight requires PERFECT execution!

### Pre-Combat Preparation (MANDATORY):

```
BUFFS (ALL REQUIRED):
1. Bless (all party) - +1 to hit
2. Prayer (all party) - +1 to hit/damage/saves
3. Enlarge (all fighters) - +1 to hit, +6 damage
4. Haste (all fighters) - doubles attacks!
5. Protection from Evil (all party) - +2 AC, +2 saves
6. Resist Fire (if available)
7. Potion of Giant Strength (best fighter) - 18(00) STR = +3 hit/+6 damage

TOTAL TO-HIT BONUS: +3 from buffs + +1 weapon minimum = +4
This raises hit chance from ~10% to ~30% against AC -3!
```

### Opening Round (CRITICAL):

**"The smartest thing is to attack him right away and keep throwing Hold Person spells until he and his guards succumb."**

1. **Hold Person x4-5 on Captain and guards** (ALL clerics cast!)
   - Captain has high saves (may take 3-4 attempts)
   - Guards easier to hold (33 HP, can be paralyzed)
   - **KEEP CASTING until Captain is held!**

2. **Magic Missile x4-6 on Captain** (if Hold Person fails)
   - Auto-hit (bypasses AC -3)
   - Each casts 2d4+2 damage (5-10 HP)
   - 6 Magic Missiles = 30-60 damage (chunks Captain's HP)

3. **Fireball on grouped guards** (if positioned)
   - 10d6 damage to multiple guards
   - Softens them up for melee

### If Captain Is Held (BEST OUTCOME):

1. **ALL attacks on Captain** (he's helpless!)
2. Auto-hit sleeping Captain (110 HP total)
3. Kill him before Hold Person expires
4. Clean up guards after

### If Captain Is NOT Held (EMERGENCY):

1. **All fighters attack Captain** (need +4 to-hit bonuses minimum!)
2. **Keep Magic Missile ready** (guaranteed damage)
3. **Have clerics heal** anyone below 20 HP (Captain deals 28 max damage per round!)
4. **Focus all damage on Captain** (guards are secondary threat)

### Expected Battle Length:

- **With Hold Person on Captain**: 3-5 rounds (Captain helpless, easy kill)
- **Without Hold Person**: 8-12 rounds (110 HP + AC -3 = very long fight)

### Expected Casualties:

- **With Hold Person**: 0-1 deaths (if guards get lucky hits)
- **Without Hold Person**: 1-3 deaths likely (Captain deals massive damage)
- **Have Raise Dead funds ready**: 1,000 GP per character

### Loot from Captain (BEST IN GAME):

- **PLATE MAIL +3** (AC -2, BEST ARMOR IN ENTIRE GAME!)
- **LONG SWORD +4** (1d8+4 damage, BEST ONE-HANDED WEAPON!)
- **SHIELD +2** (AC -2 bonus, stacks with armor)

**Equipment Value**: 30,000-40,000 GP equivalent (priceless for final dungeon!)

**Tactical Importance**:
- **Plate Mail +3**: Fighter with this + Shield +2 = AC -4!!! (unhittable!)
- **Long Sword +4**: Used to defeat Tyranthraxus (best weapon in game!)
- **Shield +2**: Stacks with armor (gives AC -2)

---

## Five Waves at Barracks (Full Assault Route)

### Location #2: Barracks - Wave Battles

If you attack the barracks, you trigger five consecutive waves of enemies:

**Wave 1: Buccaneers**
- 10-12 Level 3 Fighters
- AC: 4, HP: ~18 each
- Standard combat

**Wave 2: Mixed Buccaneers and Fighters**
- 8-10 Level 3-4 Fighters
- AC: 3-4, HP: ~22 each
- Slightly tougher

**Wave 3: Elite Buccaneers**
- 8-10 Level 5 Fighters
- AC: 2, HP: ~30 each
- Hold Person effective

**Wave 4: High-Level Fighters**
- 6-8 Level 6 Fighters
- AC: 2, HP: ~39 each
- Dangerous, use area spells

**Wave 5: Captain's Guards (Pre-Boss)**
- 6-8 Level 6-8 Fighters
- AC: 0-2, HP: ~39 each
- Hardest wave before Captain

**Total Enemies**: ~40-50 fighters across all waves

**Resource Management**:
- Use Sleep on lower-level waves (if they qualify)
- Hold Person on waves 3-5
- Fireball on grouped enemies
- **Save highest-level spells for Captain!**

### Location #4: Slave Pen

**Description**: A prison area where buccaneers keep captured slaves.

|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Captain (BEST!) | Plate Mail +3, Long Sword +4, Shield +2 | 30,000-40,000 GP |

---

## Combat Strategy Guide

### Hold Person Spam Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Why Hold Person**:
- Captain has AC -3 (nearly unhittable without hold)
- Hold Person bypasses AC entirely
- Held enemies auto-hit
- 110 HP Ã· 20 damage per round = 5-6 rounds vs. 15+ rounds

**How to Execute**:
1. **ALL clerics memorize Hold Person x4-5**
2. **Purchase Hold Person scrolls** (backup)
3. **Round 1: ALL clerics cast Hold Person on Captain**
4. **Round 2: Continue Hold Person if failed**
5. **Keep casting until Captain held**
6. **Kill helpless Captain**

### Hit Chance vs. AC -3

Without buffs:
- Level 8 Fighter (THAC0 13): Needs 16 on d20 = 25% hit chance
- Level 7 Fighter (THAC0 14): Needs 17 on d20 = 20% hit chance

With full buffs (+3 to-hit):
- Level 8 Fighter: Needs 13 on d20 = 40% hit chance
- Level 7 Fighter: Needs 14 on d20 = 35% hit chance

**This is why Hold Person is CRITICAL!**

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Buying Heir's Freedom
**Problem**: Lose 30,000-50,000 GP, miss best equipment in game
**Solution**: Fight Captain for Plate Mail +3 and Long Sword +4

### 2. Not Spamming Hold Person on Captain
**Problem**: Captain has AC -3 and 110 HP, takes 15+ rounds to kill
**Solution**: ALL clerics cast Hold Person repeatedly until Captain held

### 3. Not Buffing Before Captain Fight
**Problem**: Can't hit AC -3, Captain one-shots party members
**Solution**: Bless + Prayer + Enlarge + Haste + Protection from Evil + Giant Strength

### 4. Attempting This Quest Too Early
**Problem**: Level 6-7 parties will wipe against Captain
**Solution**: Wait until level 8-9, have 150+ total party HP

### 5. Not Bringing Enough Hold Person Spells
**Problem**: Run out of Hold Person attempts, forced to fight Captain normally
**Solution**: Memorize Hold Person x4-5 per cleric, bring scrolls

### 6. Targeting Guards Before Captain
**Problem**: Captain free to attack, deals 28 damage per round
**Solution**: Hold/kill Captain FIRST, guards are secondary

### 7. Not Saving Before Captain Fight
**Problem**: Party wipe = lose 30+ minutes of wave battles
**Solution**: Save after Wave 5, before Captain encounter

- [ ] Shield +2 (Captain) - Excellent defensive item
- [ ] Various +1 equipment (Five waves)
- [ ] Coins and gems (~5,000-8,000 GP from all sources)

---

## After Completing Buccaneer Base

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Resurrect dead party members (if any)
2. **EQUIP Plate Mail +3 on main tank** (AC -2!)
3. **EQUIP Long Sword +4 on best fighter** (save for Tyranthraxus!)
4. **EQUIP Shield +2 on tank** (stack with Plate Mail +3 = AC -4!)
5. Return to New Phlan
6. Report to quest giver (reward + ~5,000-6,000 XP)
7. Sell unwanted loot
8. Train to level up (probably hit level 9-10!)

**Equipment Synergy**:
- Plate Mail +3 (AC -2) + Shield +2 (AC -2) = **AC -4 total!**
- With Ring of Protection +2: **AC -6!** (nearly unhittable!)
- Long Sword +4: 1d8+4 damage = 5-12 per hit (best weapon!)

**Recommended Next Location**:
- **Level 9-10**: [Valjevo Castle](ValjevoCastle.md) - **FINAL DUNGEON!**

**You're now ready for endgame!**

---

## Notes and Tips

1. **Captain > Tyranthraxus**: Captain is literally harder than final boss (110 HP, AC -3 vs. 88 HP, AC 0)!
2. **Hold Person Mandatory**: Without it, Captain fight takes 15+ rounds and you'll lose characters
3. **Best Equipment**: Plate Mail +3 and Long Sword +4 are THE best in entire game
4. **Long Sword +4 vs. Tyranthraxus**: This weapon is essential for final boss
5. **Late-Game Quest**: Don't attempt until level 8-9 minimum
6. **Save Frequently**: Save after each wave, before Captain
7. **Resurrection Budget**: Bring 3,000-5,000 GP for deaths
8. **Hold Person Scrolls**: Buy extras as backup (50-100 GP each)
9. **Giant Strength Potion**: Use on best fighter vs. Captain (+3 hit/+6 damage)
10. **AC -4 Tank**: Plate Mail +3 + Shield +2 = nearly unkillable tank for final dungeon!
