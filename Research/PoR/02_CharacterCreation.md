## Character Creation Overview

Pool of Radiance allows you to create up to 6 custom characters for your party. Character creation involves several important decisions that will affect your entire adventure and potential transfers to sequel games.

### Creation Process
1. **Modify or Create Character**
2. **Choose Race** (Human, Elf, Half-Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling)
3. **Choose Gender** (Male or Female)
4. **Choose Class** (Fighter, Cleric, Magic-User, Thief, or multi-class)
5. **Roll Ability Scores** (or accept default rolls)
6. **Choose Alignment** (Lawful Good, Neutral Good, etc.)
7. **Name Your Character**
8. **Confirm and Add to Party**

### Important First-Time Considerations
- **Take your time** - Good characters make the entire game easier
- **Roll for high stats** - Reroll until you get strong ability scores
- **Plan for the long term** - Characters can transfer to sequels
- **Diversity matters** - A balanced party is more effective than specialists

## Ability Scores

Each character has six ability scores ranging from 3 (terrible) to 18 (exceptional), with fighters potentially having 18(01) to 18(00) Strength.

---

### Cleric
**Prime Requisite:** Wisdom

**Available to:** Humans, Half-Elves, Gnomes

**Recommended Ability Scores:**
- WIS: 18 (for bonus spells)

**Turn Undead:**
Clerics can attempt to turn (frighten away) or destroy undead creatures:

|--------------|----------|--------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1-2          | 10       | 13     | 16    | 19     | 20    | -     |
| 3-4          | 7        | 10     | 13    | 16     | 19    | 20    |
| 5-6          | T        | 7      | 10    | 13     | 16    | 19    |

**T = Automatic Turn, D = Automatic Destroy**

**CRITICAL:** Human clerics can reach level 6+, gaining the ability to DESTROY undead instead of just turning them. This is a huge power jump. Non-human clerics cap at level 5.

## Multi-Classing

Multi-classing allows non-human characters to advance in multiple classes simultaneously. This is one of the most powerful features in Pool of Radiance.

### Multi-Class Rules

**Basics:**

## Recommended Party Compositions

Based on the official Cluebook and experienced player advice.

### Optimal Party (Cluebook Recommended)
1. **Male Elf Fighter/Magic-User** (Lawful Good)
2. **Male Elf Fighter/Magic-User** (Lawful Good)
3. **Male Elf Fighter/Magic-User** (Lawful Good)
4. **Male Half-Elf Cleric/Fighter/Magic-User** (Lawful Good)
5. **Female Human Cleric** (Lawful Good)
6. **Male Elf Fighter/Magic-User/Thief** (Lawful Good)

**Why This Works:**
- 4 characters who can fight effectively (all fighter multi-class)
- 2 characters who can cast cleric spells (healing covered)
- 5 characters who can cast mage spells (massive offensive magic)
- 1 thief for lock picking (convenient, not essential)
- Human cleric reaches level 6+ (Destroy Undead ability)
- All Lawful Good (no alignment conflicts)

**Alternative:** Replace F/MU/T with a straight F/MU for faster progression

### Balanced Party (Beginner Friendly)
1. **Human Fighter** (front-line tank)
2. **Elf Fighter/Magic-User** (versatile combatant)
3. **Elf Fighter/Magic-User** (versatile combatant)
4. **Half-Elf Cleric/Fighter** (combat medic)
5. **Human Cleric** (dedicated healer)
6. **Elf Fighter/Thief** OR **Elf Fighter/Magic-User/Thief** (skills + combat)

**Why This Works:**
- Clear role divisions

### Power-Gaming Party (Maximum Optimization)

3. **Male Elf Fighter/Magic-User**

5. **Female Human Cleric**
6. **Male Half-Elf Cleric/Fighter/Magic-User**

**Why This Works:**
- 4 F/MU for maximum combat/magic synergy
- Human Cleric for Destroy Undead
- C/F/MU for ultimate versatility
- Can handle any situation
- Skip thief (not essential for Pool of Radiance)

**Downside:** No dedicated thief (must bash doors/chests or use Knock spell)

### All-Human Party (Sequel Planning)
1. **Human Fighter**
2. **Human Fighter**
3. **Human Cleric**
4. **Human Cleric**
5. **Human Magic-User**
6. **Human Thief** (or second Magic-User)

**Why This Works:**

- Unlimited advancement potential
- Fastest level progression (no XP splitting)

### Hit Point Maximization

**Manual of Bodily Health:**

- Found in Mendor's Library
- Can be duplicated via exploit (save/load cycling)

**Maximize HP Strategy:**
1. Increase Constitution as high as possible early
2. Use Manual of Bodily Health before leveling
3. Multi-class characters get averaged HP (round down)
4. Fighters get best HP progression

**Expected HP by Level 5:**
- Fighter (CON 18): ~45-55 HP
- Cleric (CON 16): ~30-40 HP
- Magic-User (CON 16): ~15-20 HP

- F/MU (CON 18): ~35-45 HP

### Ability Score Improvement

- Potion of Giant Strength (18(00) STR temporarily)
- Potions of other abilities (found rarely)

### Spell Acquisition (Magic-Users)

**Automatic Spells:**
- Gain spells when leveling up
- Number based on Intelligence

**Learning from Scrolls:**
- Find spell scrolls (Magic-User scrolls)
- Scribe into spellbook (chance based on INT)
- 18 INT = best chance to learn
- Can fail - scroll is destroyed

**Essential Spells to Find:**
- Sleep (usually start with this)
- Magic Missile
- Stinking Cloud
- Fireball
- Haste
- Lightning Bolt

### Equipment Progression

**Early Game (Levels 1-3):**
- Banded Mail + Shield (fighters/clerics)
- Leather armor (thieves/multi-class)
- Long swords, maces
- Composite Long Bow (buy for 25,000 gold - worth it!)

## Advanced Character Planning

### Transfer to Sequels

Characters can transfer to **Curse of the Azure Bonds** and subsequent games:

**What Transfers:**
- Character stats
- Experience/levels
- Equipment (some)
- Spells known

**Transfer Limitations:**
- Stats above 18 round down to 18 (except STR 18(00))
- Some items don't transfer
- Strength transfer bug (requires hex editing to fix)
- Multi-class characters may lose HP on first training

**Transfer Recommendations:**
- Maximize stats (18 in primary abilities)
- Use Manual of Bodily Health before transferring
- Get best equipment before transfer
- Consider single-class for long-term play

### Min-Maxing Strategies

**Stat Rolling:**
- Keep rolling until you get multiple 18s
- Prioritize: DEX 18, primary stat 18, CON 18
- Can take hours to get perfect rolls
- Worth it for optimal play

**Race Selection:**
- Elves for Fighter/Magic-User (most versatile)
- Humans for pure Clerics (no level cap on Turn Undead)
- Half-Elves for triple-class (ultimate flexibility)

**Gender Considerations:**
- Males: Better Strength (18(00) possible for fighters)
- Females: Gauntlets of Power fix Elf STR limitation
- Minimal difference otherwise

**Alignment:**
- Lawful Good recommended (most options)
- Avoid evil alignments (some quest restrictions)
- Neutral works fine
- Party alignment conflicts can occur

### Exploits & Bugs

**Item Duplication:**
1. Remove character from party
2. Save game
3. Give items to temporary character
4. Remove temporary character
5. Load game
6. Re-add temporary character (now has duplicate items)

**Manual of Bodily Health:**
Can be duplicated to give entire party CON 18+

**Stat Modification:**
Before starting adventure, can modify character stats in character creation screen

**Cheat Mode:**
Start game with "START STING" or "ST STING" for:
- J key: Free training
- Alt-X: Instant combat victory

**Copy Protection Removal:**
Hex edit START.EXE or GAME.OVR to disable code wheel
